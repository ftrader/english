[[!template id=see_also Mining]]
A **bitcoin mine** is a facility designated specifically for [[mining]] bitcoins. Other terms, such as "**bitcoin farm**" or "**bitcoin factory**" are also used. As [[ASIC]] mining became highly optimized, increasing [[hashrate]] involved simply buying more chips. Buildings would have to be dedicated to house copious amounts of hardware used for mining, and are usually located in areas with inexpensive electricity and relatively cold climate.
