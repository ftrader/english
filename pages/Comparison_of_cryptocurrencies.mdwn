This article aims to list relevant cryptocurrencies, even those too minor to have their own wiki entry. See also [[tags/Alternative_cryptocurrencies]]

# Currencies

The order / grouping of these coins are still TBD.

[Ripper234](User:Ripper234) proposes a grouping of Major, Minor and New by an arbitrary market cap limit. This can be done once the market caps of the alts are known.

* Using market cap will make Tonal Bitcoin a "Major" despite de facto minor usage. Therefore, I suggest finding a different method of categorizing. --[Luke-jr](User:Luke-jr) ([[talk|User_talk:Luke-jr]]) 05:06, 4 March 2013 (GMT)
