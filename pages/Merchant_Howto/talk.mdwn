I think most merchant will want to also also automatically adjust their prices according to BTC market value.

Has anyone here done this? It doesn't seem too hard to pull the rate from mtgox at a certain depth or something, but I'd hate to describe something I've never done myself.

Also, I this is lacking any mention of mybitcoin and mtgox merchant apis.

So please, can someone help? Making it easier for merchants to use bitcoin is important.
