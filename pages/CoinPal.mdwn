**CoinPal** was an exchange that accepted [[PayPal]] for relatively small order sizes and a weekly limit on purchases. 

The site was first publicly available on December 31, 2010 (1.1).  On January 14th, 2010 CoinPal introduced an API that allows merchants and others seeking payment to use the service to accept micro-payments (1.2). The operator of the site also operates [[CoinCard]] for [[selling_bitcoins]].

On April 30th PayPal froze the exchange operator's PayPal account and the exchange announced that service had ended (1.3).

##Weekly Limits
There was a limit on the number of bitcoins each customer can buy each week. This limit depends on the amount of time that has passed since the customer's first order.



|Minimum days since customer's first order|Weekly limit
|---|---
|0|20
|3|40
|7|60
|14|100
|45|160


Those trading on [[Bitcoin OTC|Bitcoin-otc]] can increase their weekly purchase limits by connecting CoinPal to the [[OTC web of trust|Bitcoin-otc]] (2.1).
