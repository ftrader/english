**CoinPal** is an exchange that accepts [[PayPal]] for relatively small order sizes and a weekly limit on purchases. For new customers, the weekly limit is BTC 40. 14 days after a customer's first order, the weekly limit increases to BTC 60. 45 days after the first order, the limit becomes BTC 80.

The site was first publicly available on December 31, 2010 (1.1).  On January 14th, 2010 CoinPal introduced an API that allows merchants and others seeking payment to use the service to accept micro-payments (1.2).

The operator of the site also operates [[CoinCard]] for [[selling_bitcoins]].
