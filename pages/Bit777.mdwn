Where Can I Win a Mystery Jackpot?

Bit777's Mystery Jackpots pay out randomly on selected table games.

How Do The Mystery Jackpots Work?

* Each Mystery Jackpot is assigned a minimum and maximum value
* The jackpot is guaranteed to pay out somewhere between the maximum and minimum value as determined by the Random Number Generator. Someone will win before the maximum value is reached
* Different maximum and minimum value Mystery Jackpots are assigned throughout the casino. The player could win hundreds, thousands or even hundreds of thousands of hands!
* Each time a player spins, his could be the play that triggers a Mystery Jackpot payout.

When do the Mystery Jackpots Happen?

They are happening all the time. No one knows just when or where a Mystery Jackpot will strike nor how much there is up for grabs. It's all up to chance... that's why we call it a mystery and that's where the excitement lies!

Do I Need To Hit A Winning Combination To Win?

No, the player doesn't need to hit a winning combination to win the Mystery Jackpot! He is still playing for the standard jackpots, but Mystery Jackpots give the player an extra chance to walk away with bonus cash and prizes. And the best thing about it is that he doesn't even have to hit a winning combination to win!
What are the Mystery Jackpot Winning Ranges?

He can win a Mystery Jackpot when the jackpot amount is in the following ranges:

* Silver Mystery: 10 - 30 credits
* Gold Mystery: 50 - 100 credits
* Platinum Mystery: 150 - 250 credits
