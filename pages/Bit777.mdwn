##Instant Gamble

Instant Gamble Rules


1. Choose % to Gamble instantly on the deposit page [here](click)
2. Deposit Bitcoins to your Bit777 deposit address [here](click)
3. If the Gamble is won, the bonus is automatically credited to your account (-1% commission). If the Gamble is lost, the set % is withheld from your deposit


NOTE:
	- The Gamble is active for all consecutive deposits, unless switched off by the user
	- The maximum Gamble is 1btc (100 credits)

How the Instant Gamble works:

After you set a %, the system will enter standby mode, awaiting your next deposit. Once the deposit is received, the system takes the hashes that come with the transaction and converts them in True/False state

If the result is:
TRUE – You win! Your account is credited with the set percentage minus 1% commission
FALSE – You lose. The set percentage is deducted from your account


How TRUE/FALSE is determined:
True/False is based on Odd/Even
The blockchain generates 2 hashes with every deposit of yours
We combine HASH1 and HASH2 and get the final HASH
Each symbol in the HASH has a unique digit value. We sum up all digits to get a True/False result

##Mystery Jackpots

Bit777‘s Mystery Jackpots offer the players an additional chance to win even if they don’t have a winning combination. Over and above the standard jackpots, Mystery Jackpot payouts won’t affect player's normal game play or the standard jackpot amounts. To win a Mystery Jackpot grab a seat at any marked table game and get playing!

Where Can I Win a Mystery Jackpot?

Bit777's Mystery Jackpots pay out randomly on selected table games.

How Do The Mystery Jackpots Work?

* Each Mystery Jackpot is assigned a minimum and maximum value
* The jackpot is guaranteed to pay out somewhere between the maximum and minimum value as determined by the Random Number Generator. Someone will win before the maximum value is reached
* Different maximum and minimum value Mystery Jackpots are assigned throughout the casino. The player could win hundreds, thousands or even hundreds of thousands of hands!
* Each time a player spins, his could be the play that triggers a Mystery Jackpot payout.

When do the Mystery Jackpots Happen?

They are happening all the time. No one knows just when or where a Mystery Jackpot will strike nor how much there is up for grabs. It's all up to chance... that's why we call it a mystery and that's where the excitement lies!

Do I Need To Hit A Winning Combination To Win?

No, the player doesn't need to hit a winning combination to win the Mystery Jackpot! He is still playing for the standard jackpots, but Mystery Jackpots give the player an extra chance to walk away with bonus cash and prizes. And the best thing about it is that he doesn't even have to hit a winning combination to win!
What are the Mystery Jackpot Winning Ranges?

He can win a Mystery Jackpot when the jackpot amount is in the following ranges:

* Silver Mystery: 10 - 30 credits
* Gold Mystery: 50 - 100 credits
* Platinum Mystery: 150 - 250 credits
