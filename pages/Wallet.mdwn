A Bitcoin **wallet** is a collection of private keys but may also refer to [[client software|Clients]] used to manage those keys and to make transactions on the Bitcoin network.

This page covers various wallet formats in use.

### [[Bitcoin_Core]]

The original Bitcoin client stores private key information in a file named **wallet.dat** following the so called ["bitkeys"](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=4448.0) format.  

It contains:

* keypairs for each of your [[addresses|address]]
* transactions done from/to your addresses
* user preferences 
* default key
* reserve keys
* [[accounts|Accounts_explained]]
* a version number
* [[Key_pool]]
* Since 0.3.21: information about the current best chain, to be able to rescan automatically when restoring from a backup.

The wallet.dat file is located in the [[Bitcoin data directory|data_directory]].

It is intended that a wallet file be used on only one installation of Bitcoin at a time.  Attempting to clone a wallet file for use on multiple computers will result in "weird behavior" (2.1).

The format of this file is Berkeley DB.  Tools that can manipulate wallet files include [[pywallet]].

### [[Armory]]

The Armory client uses a custom [[Deterministic_wallet]] format [described here](https://www.bitcoinarmory.com/wallet-format/) and runs on top of [[Bitcoin_Core]].

### [[Blockchain.info|Blockchain.info#Wallet]]

Blockchain.info offers a [[hybrid eWallet|Browser-based_wallet#Hybrid_e-wallets]] called "My Wallet".  It use a plain text [JSON wallet format](https://blockchain.info/wallet/wallet-format). Private keys Keys are stored in base58.

### [[Multibit]]

Multibit HD (the current version) uses a [[BIP_0032]] (type 2) [[Deterministic_wallet]] with the [format described here](https://www.multibit.org/en/help/hd0.1/files.html).  The "Classic" version used the bitcoinj [protobuf](https://github.com/google/protobuf) wallet file.
