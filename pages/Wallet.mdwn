A Bitcoin **wallet** is a piece of software used to manage private keys and to make transactions on the Bitcoin network.  Wallets may offer additional features such as address labels, contacts, signing messages, etc.

### Bitcoin Qt

The original Bitcoin [[client|Clients]] stores private key information in a file named **wallet.dat** acording to the so called  (2.1):

* keypairs for each of your [[addresses|address]]
* transactions done from/to your addresses
* user preferences 
* default key
* reserve keys
* [[accounts|Accounts_explained]]
* a version number
* [[Key_pool]]
* Since 0.3.21: information about the current best chain, to be able to rescan automatically when restoring from a backup.

The data file for the wallet is wallet.dat and is located in the [[Bitcoin data directory|data_directory]].

It is intended that a wallet be used on only one installation of Bitcoin at a time.  Attempting to clone a wallet for use on multiple computers will result in "weird behavior" (2.2).

The format of this file is Berkeley DB.  Tools that can manipulate wallet files include [[pywallet]].

### [[Armory]]

The [[Armory]] client uses a custom [binary wallet format](http://bitcoinarmory.com/developers/armory-wallet-files/) and runs on top of Bitcoin-Core (3.1).

### Blockchain.info

Blockchain.info use a plain text JSON wallet format documented [here](https://blockchain.info/wallet/wallet-format). Private keys Keys are stored in base58.


### [[Cubits]]

Cubits.com has both cold and hot wallet, with all user's funds stored securely in the cold wallet.

### Multibit

Multibit uses the bitcoinj [protobuf](http://code.google.com/p/protobuf/) wallet file.
