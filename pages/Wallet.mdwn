### Bitcoin Qt

The original Bitcoin  [[client|Clients]] wallet file is named **wallet.dat** and contains (2.1):

* transactions done from/to your addresses
* user preferences 
* default key
* reserve keys
* [[accounts|Accounts_explained]]
* a version number
* [[Key_pool]]
* Since 0.3.21: information about the current best chain, to be able to rescan automatically when restoring from a backup.

The data file for the wallet is wallet.dat and is located in the [[Bitcoin data directory|data_directory]].
