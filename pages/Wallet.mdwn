A Bitcoin **wallet** is a file that contains a collection of private keys. 

### Bitcoin Qt

The original Bitcoin client wallet file is named **wallet.dat** and contains (2.1):

* keypairs for each of your [[addresses|address]]
* transactions done from/to your addresses
* user preferences 
* default key
* reserve keys
* [[accounts|Accounts_explained]]
* a version number
* [[Key_pool]]
* Since 0.3.21: information about the current best chain, to be able to rescan automatically when restoring from a backup.

The data file for the wallet is wallet.dat and is located in the [[Bitcoin data directory|data_directory]].

It is intended that a wallet be used on only one installation of Bitcoin at a time.  Attempting to clone a wallet for use on multiple computers will result in "weird behavior" (2.2).

The format of this file is Berkeley DB.  Tools that can manipulate wallet files include [[pywallet]].

### Armory

The Armory client uses a custom [binary wallet format](http://bitcoinarmory.com/developers/armory-wallet-files/).

### Blockchain.info

Blockchain.info use a plain text JSON wallet format documented [here](https://blockchain.info/wallet/wallet-format). Private keys Keys are stored in base58.

### [[Coinkite]]

[Coinkite](https://coinkite.com/promo/wiki) is the only web wallet using ["HD Wallet (BIP32)"](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/BIP_0032) technology, which can be shared partially or entirely with different systems, each with or without the ability to spend coins  [here](https://coinkite.com/faq). Private keys Keys are sent to you encrypted with AES-256-CBC.

### Multibit

Multibit uses the bitcoinj [protobuf](http://code.google.com/p/protobuf/) wallet file.

### [[Bitcoin_Wallet]]

Bitcoin Wallet uses the bitcoinj [protobuf](http://code.google.com/p/protobuf/) format for its wallet file. However, due to Android isolation of applications, it is impossible to access the wallet file as a non-root user.
