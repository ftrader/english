Based in Keith and Aberdeen, Epic Tree Care is well placed to provide forestry and arboricultural services across the North East of Scotland including Emergency Response in the aftermath of storm or lightning damage. A qualified and experienced team of highly skilled operational [Arborists](http://en.bitcoin.it/) offers a cost-effective solution for the long-term management of trees and hedges. Epic Tree Care maintains a firm environmental policy and recycles 99% of all waste. All operational staff are members of professional organisations such as the Arboricultural Association [[1]].

'Epic Tree Care also supplies firewood logs from sustainable sources collected during tree surgery operations. Using wood as fuel to heat homes, heat water and to cook is a natural way of recycling. In addition, wood chip is available all year round and is perfect in the garden for keeping weeds at bay on flower beds, maintaining soil moisture and helping to improve soil texture. It can also be used within equestrian centres and in children’s playgrounds. [[!img "tree-surgeon-aberdeen.jpg_‎" size=120x120 title="Tree Surgery, Epic Tree Care"]]
