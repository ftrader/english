BitInstant is a new service that allows you to quickly and easily transfer funds into your online exchange account without delay.

It provides a means to rapidly topup your account at one of several bitcoin exchanges far faster than the usual methods. 

Bitinstant makes most deposits happen instantly - within a matter of seconds in ideal cases, and in an absolute worst-case scenario they will still aim to have funds into your exchange account before a stated maximum deadline (on average about 30 minutes depending on various conditions).

##History

The BitInstant Project was founded by two BitCoin traders Gareth Nelson and Charlie Shrem who saw the need for a quick, easy, and secure way of transferring funds to their Exchange accounts.

It was announced through the media on August 23, 2011 (9.1).

BitInstant is based out of New York City with an office in the United Kingdom. 

On April 16, 2012 the service began offering Coinapult as a destination option for the funds (9.2).  With Coinapult, BitInstant cash deposits are converted to bitcoins which are then claimed through e-mail or from a mobile phone (SMS / text message).

One June 5,2012 the service launched its integration with the [[BitcoinSpinner]] mobile app, simplifying the purchase of bitcoins using a mobile app (9.3).
