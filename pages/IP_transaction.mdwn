Sending bitcoins to an IP address was a convenient way of sending bitcoins to a Bitcoin address along with additional information.

* You contact the IP address to find out if they're actually running Bitcoin and accepting IP transactions. If not, no transaction occurs.
* Your additional information ("from", "message", etc.) is exchanged with the server.
* The server generates a brand new Bitcoin address and sends it to you.
* You send coins to this [[address]] in the normal way

Unfortunately, the current implementation provides no authentication, so any "man in the middle" can intercept your Bitcoins during the transaction. When they see that you're sending a Bitcoin payment by IP address, they pretend to be the actual destination and send back *their* Bitcoin address. You end up sending Bitcoins to the wrong person. It's therefore no longer a good idea to send Bitcoins in this way, *especially* if you're using a proxy.

##Status
Receiving transactions by IP address is disabled by default with the classic Bitcoin client. You can enable it by running Bitcoin with the *-allowreceivebyip* switch.  This feature has been removed from the classic Bitcoin client, as-of v0.8.0 (2.1)
