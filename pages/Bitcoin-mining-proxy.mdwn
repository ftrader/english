A multi-pool, multi-worker proxy for Bitcoin miners, supporting long polling and pool failover.

This software allows multiple miners to be run against multiple pools with fail-over to other pools if something happens to a miner's preferred pool.  It requires a web server supporting PHP, and a MySQL database.

The software is open source (AGPLv3) and was released on May 4, 2011 (1.1).
