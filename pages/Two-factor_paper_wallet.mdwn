I believe it was Casascius that once talked about the idea of a "2 factor paper wallet".  TL;DR - it's a system to securely generate BTC addresses given the risk of any particular machine being injected with trojans. 

(If you can find the original discussion, that would be great)

## How it works

1. Trusted 3rd party generates a key pair (*Private_1*, *Public_1*), and sends them to you in the form of laminated paper. *Public_1* is derivable from *Private_1*. The keys are deleted after sending.
1. You generate an addition key pair (*Private_2*, *Public_2*) on your own machine.
1. You cryptographically combine *Public_1* and *Public_2* and get *Public_final* - a Bitcoin address.
1. You transfer BTC into *Public_final*
1. At a later time, when you want to withdraw funds from it, you combine *Private_1* and *Private_2* to get *Private_final*, and withdraw.

The point of the system is that an attacker would have to break into both your systems in order to withdraw funds. It is a way to securely store Bitcoins even if your system potentially contains trojans, without trusting a 3rd party. This scheme can in fact be done with N parties, with each additional part just adding security to the system (suspect Party1 is a CIA snitch? That's ok, because all it takes for this to be secure is one secure party).
