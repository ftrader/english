An easy shopping cart interface allowing a site to easily accept bitcoins as payment.

### How It Works

* A buyer clicks your 'Buy with BTC' button / link.
* After they have selected to purchase your offer, they will be prompted to enter their Bitcoin client and transfer the BTC.
* Once we have received enough confirmations, we will POST the purchase information to a URL your specify.
* Upon receiving a POST notification, you will simply verify the message came from BitWillet and redirect the user to the URL for the digital goods you are selling.
* Optionally, you can record the purchase information for future reference!

The service is built on Willet which can also be used to accept credit card payments.

The service was launched on June 28, 2011 (2.1).
