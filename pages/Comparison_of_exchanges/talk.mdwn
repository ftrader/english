Because bitcoin is a global currency, this format is going to be confusing at best.

Some exchanges trade just one currency, others such as TradeHill trade multiples.

Wondering if there shouldn't be a comparison on a per-currency basis.

e.g. USD for only those exchanges who trade BTC/USD.  A EUR table for only those exchanges who trade BTC/EUR.  The problem though is duplication.  There is a TradeHill entry in each of those examples.

Yes duplication is a problem, but this huge tabular is just too big and makes stuff hard to find.
I try to restructure it....  and I failed... wiki tables are just not easyly editable... sorry.
