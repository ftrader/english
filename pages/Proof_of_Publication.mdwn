A method that uses Bitcoin or Bitcoin-like technologies to authenticate that a certain information was published at a certain date, or was known at a certain date.

The technique entails encoding the secure hash of a certain publication (plaintext) inside the Bitcoin blockchain. It was probablly first described in the paper from 2012 titled "CommitCoin: Carbon Dating Commitments with Bitcoin" ([extended abstract](http://people.scs.carleton.ca/~clark/papers/2012_fc.pdf) and [technical report](http://eprint.iacr.org/2011/677.pdf)).
