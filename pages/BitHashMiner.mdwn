They offered a single product, also called a **BitHashMiner**, which was a preorder [[mining rig|ASIC]] with supernatural specs at an unrealistically low price.
##Hardware
The rig itself featured 10 T[[hash/s]] for $1,000, with 25 20nm 400 Ghash/s [[ASIC]] chips. (2.1) There is a screen on the miner depicting a [[CGMiner]] instance with two graphics cards [[Scrypt]] mining. (2.1) (2.2) There are also two 750W power supplies, which weigh about 5 pounds each, meaning that the casing, fans, and chips must weigh less than 0 pounds, and would float away without the power supplies weighing them down. (2.1) (2.3)

The rigs were offered with free shipping and a five year warranty, and were expected to ship in April. (2.1) (2.4)
