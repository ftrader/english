[[!template id=infobox_company image=[[File:Logo-bithashminer.png 256px]] industry="[[ASIC]] manufacturing" foundation="February 2, 2015" defunct="February 9, 2015" location=India employees=1 bitcointalk=430668 bitcoinwiki=BitHashMiner.com]]**BitHashMiner** was a vaporware scam notorious for being very poorly executed, and persisting carelessly. A single product was offered, also called a **BitHashMiner**, which was a preorder [[mining rig|ASIC]] with supernatural specs at an unrealistically low price. The scam has been labelled by onlookers as "thread gold", (1.1) "hysterical", (1.2) "the most blatant scam attempt", (1.3) "the yoda sales force", (1.4) "obvious scam", (1.5) "mind blowing", (1.6) and "half ass attempt to scam people". (1.7) It is remembered as the most futile scam attempt in Bitcoin history and is used as a textbook example of vaporware, helping people identify scams on their own.

The scam was an unintentional exhibition of many warning signs and red flags that deterred potential victims.

##Hardware
[[BitcoinTalk]]
The 9 lb. rig itself featured 10 T[[hash/s]] for $1000, with 25 20nm [[ASIC]] chips. (2.1) There is a screen on the miner depicting a [[CGMiner]] instance with two graphics cards [[Scrypt]] mining in late 2013. (2.1) (2.2) There are also two 750W power supplies, (2.1) which weigh about 5 lbs. each, (2.3) meaning that the casing, fans, and chips must have negative weight, and would be at risk of floating away without the power supplies weighing them down. (2.4)

There was an enforced limit of two items per buyer, (2.1) which is a telltale sign of a dishonest sale. (2.5)

The rigs were offered with free shipping and a five year warranty, and were expected to ship in April. (2.1) (2.6) By February 12, the [[BitcoinTalk]] account of BitHashMiner was inactive and the website was down; no units ever shipped. (1.1)

##Impact
On February 7, 2015, BitHashMiner issued a statement declaring that [[Taras]] and [[TheRealSteve]], prominent editors of the [[Bitcoin_Wiki]], were "Big Gang Mafia" and that they had accepted bribes from [[HashCoins]] to keep their listing on the "[[Mining_hardware_comparison]]" page of the wiki, while removing other potential scams including BitHashMiner and [[PowerModule]].
