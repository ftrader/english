As I'm operator of competitor pool, I don't feel competent to edit this article. I'm asking somebody uninterested to fix lies in this articles talking about "miner efficiency". Better to talk about "pool efficiency" (modified miner is lowering load of pool), but this reduce miner's payout per real megahash because of higher rate of stale shares.

I've updated this article as well as [[Poclbm-mod]].  [Sgornick](User:Sgornick) 22:52, 11 March 2011 (GMT)
