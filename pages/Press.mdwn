This article lists Bitcoin-related press from the project's creation through October 2011. Since that time, due to the increased frequency of published articles, a [Press forum board](http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=77.0) was created on the BitcoinTalk Forum to allow the wider Bitcoin community to share articles as they are discovered.
