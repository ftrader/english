A commercial service that operates essentially as a private pool.  The service supports connections only from the operator's proprietary Windows client which incorporates the kernel from the [[poclbm]] miner (1.1).

Compensation is calculated on a fixed "Work Unit" method.

##Criticism

The service had been fist operating without disclosing any relationship to Bitcoin.  One of the first inquiries into the organization on February 13, 2011, yielded a response that revealed only that Compute 4 Cash was part of a distributed computing project for the financial sector (2.1).

The compensation received by the users has been calculated to be significantly less than that enjoyed by those [[mining|Pooled_mining]] using one of the public [[Pool Operators|tags/Pool_Operators]].
