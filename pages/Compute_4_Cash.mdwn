A commercial service that operates essentially as a private pool.  The service supports connections only from the operator's proprietary Windows client which incorporates the kernel from the [[poclbm]] miner (1.1).

Compensation is calculated on a fixed "Work Unit" method.

##Criticism

The service had been first operating without disclosing any relationship to Bitcoin.  One of the first inquiries into the organization on February 13, 2011, yielded a response that revealed only that Compute 4 Cash was part of a distributed computing project for the financial sector (2.1).

The compensation received by the users has been calculated to be significantly less than that enjoyed by those [[mining|Pooled_mining]] using one of the public [[pool operators|tags/Pool_Operators]].

As of Mar 29, 2011, the Compute4Cash payout is $0.089/WU. A Radeon 5870 is estimated to compute 1.150 WU/hr, for an estimated payout of $2.46/day. The expected generation output, at 313000 Khps, given current difficulty of 68978.89245792 , is 4.56406694721 BTC per day. At the current market rate of $.78/bitcoin, the value of the daily output is actually worth $3.56/day, which is a whopping 45% more than Compute4Cash pays out.
