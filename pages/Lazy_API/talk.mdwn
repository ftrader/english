Is the title descriptive of the article's contents?  Are the articles contents suitable / necessary where an article should exist?  Wouldn't this be something that, if valuable enough, is added to the [[Merchant_Howto]] and/or the [[How_to_accept_Bitcoin,_for_small_businesses]]?

Done! I'm particularly fond of this method of accepting bitcoins, since I paid a 20BTC bounty to Theymos to help make it happen. I'd hate for it to get lost.
