**Bitcoin-Central.net** is a [[currency_exchange]] based in France and operated by [[Paymium]], that allows trading between bitcoins (BTC) and a number of currencies, each with its own trading market. It is notably the first exchange to operate within the framework of European regulation and to guarantee the fiat deposits of its users. (1.1)

##Features
On December 6, 2012, Bitcoin-Central announced that: (1.1)

* User funds would be held at Aqoba's partner financial institution under the user's name, separately from [[Paymium]]'s funds
* User accounts will be individually protected up to 100,000 EUR by the [Garantie des dépôts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deposit_insurance#By_EU_country), the French equivalent of the American [FDIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Deposit_Insurance_Corporation)
* Each account would in a few months after launch get its very own IBAN number, enabling its use as any other bank account, e.g. for salary deposits with optional automatic conversion to Bitcoin
* Each user would soon be able to order their own debit card, accessing their EUR and BTC balance
* All incoming and outgoing transfers would be 100% automated via direct access to the banking networks
* Corporations would have access to an actual financial institution if they wish to start accepting Bitcoin and be safe from a regulatory point of view

Paymium hopes to have a much better legal standing and a much higher attractiveness for second and third-round investors.

On April 25, 2013, Bitcoin-Central was hacked (16.1) in a very similar attack to the one used against *Slush's* mining pool (16.2) on Linode: its current VPS provider, OVH, had its management interface compromised, which enabled the attacker to reset the password, log into the Bitcoin-Central machine, and steal the hot wallet. Coincidentally, Slush's pool on OVH was hacked again in the same attack. (16.3)
