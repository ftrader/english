[Jed McCaleb](https://about.me/JedMcCaleb) created [eDonkey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EDonkey2000), one of the largest file-sharing networks of its time, as well as Mt. Gox, the first bitcoin exchange. In 2011, Jed founded [[Ripple]]. Recognizing that the worldâ€™s financial infrastructure is broken and that too many people are left without resources, he and [Joyce Kim](https://www.media.mit.edu/video/view/kim-2015-03-20) cofounded [[Stellar]], a [universal financial network](http://www.coindesk.com/stellar-founder-jed-mccaleb-new-protocol/) that aims to increase economic participation for all individuals, in 2014. 

Jed currently leads technical development of [Stellar](https://github.com/jedmccaleb). He writes about the technical elements of the Stellar network on the Stellar.org blog (ex: [Multisig and Simple Contracts](https://www.stellar.org/blog/multisig-and-simple-contracts-stellar/)).
