Jed McCaleb created eDonkey, one of the largest file-sharing networks of its time, as well as Mt. Gox, the first bitcoin exchange. In 2011, Jed founded [[Ripple]]. Recognizing that the worldâ€™s financial infrastructure is broken and that too many people are left without resources, he cofounded [[Stellar]], , a universal financial network that aims to increase economic participation for all individuals, in 2014. 

Jed currently leads technical development of [Stellar](https://github.com/jedmccaleb). The Stellar network is supported by Stellar.org, a nonprofit that couples technology with digital financial literacy and contributes to open-source software (1.1). Jed is also an advisor to MIRI, which researches artificial intelligence for positive impact.
