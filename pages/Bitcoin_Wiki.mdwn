The **Bitcoin.it Wiki**, usually just the **Bitcoin Wiki**, is a MediaWiki repository of Bitcoin-related knowledge. It was founded by [[Martti_Malmi]] in 2010 on dokuwiki, and then later reinstated by [[Mark_Karpelès]] on MediaWiki. Malmi's and Karpelès's wikis both existed simultaneously for a short time while the contents of the old wiki were transferred to the new one. The dokuwiki revisions are visible on some old pages, highlighted green.

In early 2011, the wiki offered a Contributor's Award which was to be shared by all members depending on work contributed. 500 bitcoins were collected, but never distributed. They were presumed lost in the [[Mt._Gox]] hack.
