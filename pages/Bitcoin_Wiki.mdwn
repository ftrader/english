This is a community wiki aimed at allowing the Bitcoin community as a whole to document freely what they feel needs documentation or representation.

## Internationalization
This wiki uses a multi-lingual scheme similar to Wikipedia's, which means a translated article get links to its translation in the menu (in the left column from the [[index]]). 

If you feel one language is missing and are ready to start translating a lot of pages, you can request the creation of the language of your choice by contacting me ([MagicalTux](User:MagicalTux)).

## Backups

Backups are generated daily at 00:00 GMT, and can be downloaded from [the backup repository](https://dump.bitcoin.it/). Setting up a mirror is easy enough, as many websites explain how to restore a MediaWiki xml dump into a fresh installation.

## Contact

While I can usually be contacted on [irc](irc://irc.freenode.net/bitcoin-dev), you can also write me an [e-mail](mailto:contact@bitcoin.it). Please avoid contacting me to ask questions already answered on this wiki.

## License

When Bitcoin.it wiki was opened (on December 16th 2010), the initial license was [WTFPL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WTFPL). It has been brought up that CC-by would be more appropriate as content from the previous wiki is under CC-by.
