The **July 2015 [[flood_attack]]** is an ongoing "stress test" of the Bitcoin network. The distributed attack has provoked hundreds of thousands of [[transaction]]s, leaving over 80,000 in the [[mempool]] at one time. (1.1) (1.2) The attack is considered to be a sequel attempt to a [[previous stress test|June_2015_flood_attack]].

Some single-word [[brainwallet]]s ("password", "cat" (1.3), etc.) have been the recipients of thousands of transactions, leaving 0.00001 BTC outputs. [[F2Pool]] has been concatenating these outputs in huge 1MB transactions. (1.4) (1.5) These transactions fill up an entire block on their own, and are far too large to be relayed by nodes; they have only been confirmed because F2Pool dedicated blocks to them. (1.6) Some nodes report having spent over 20 seconds on one of these transactions, (1.7) leaving sites including [[Blockchain.info]] and [[TradeBlock]] temporarily impaired. (1.8) (1.9)

[[Peter_Todd]] may be a major contributor, as evidenced by a discussion involving him on [[/r/Buttcoin]], in which he offers to execute a stress test for $5,000. (1.10) It has also been speculated that the attack is the product of [[mining_pool]]s in an attempt to drive up transaction fees.[[!template id=citation_needed]]
