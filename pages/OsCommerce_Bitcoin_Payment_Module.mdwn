There are extension modules for osCommerce to accept bitcoin as payment has been released.

1. Bitcoin-Cash  (1.1) payment module is implemented without further needs of installing or the Bitcoin daemon. First user is the online-shop [Designers-Heaven](http://designers-heaven.de).
1.  (1.2) It has since been improved to receive notifications back from the Bitcoin daemon via a Python script. The improved version also manages incoming funds, sending them offsite to reduce risk, as well as watches and restarts the Bitcoin daemon. (1.3)
