An extension for osCommerce to accept bitcoin as payment has been released.  (1.1) It has since been improved to receive notifications back from the Bitcoin daemon via a Python script. The improved version also manages incoming funds, sending them offsite to reduce risk, as well as watches and restarts the Bitcoin daemon. (1.2)
