Electrum is a lightweight Bitcoin client.

Main features:

* Encrypted wallet
* Deterministic key generation. If you lose your wallet, you can recover it from its passphrase.
* No blockchain download; the client requests that information from a server
* Private keys are not shared with the server.
* Firewall friendly: The client does not need to open a port, it simply polls the server for updates.
* No single point of failure: The server code is open source, anyone can run a server.
* Python. Very compact code, easy to contribute.
