Electrum is a lightweight Bitcoin client, based on a client-server protocol. 
It was released on november 5, 2011.

###Main features:

* Encrypted wallet
* Deterministic key generation. If you lose your wallet, you can recover it from its passphrase.
* No blockchain download; the client requests that information from a server
* Private keys are not shared with the server.
* Firewall friendly: The client does not need to open a port, it simply polls the server for updates.
* No single point of failure: The server code is open source, anyone can run a server.
* Python. Very compact code, easy to contribute.

###Brain Wallet

Electrum uses a type 2 deterministic key generation algorithm.
This means that all the keys are derived from a seed.

Electrum makes it easy to memorize its seed, because it uses a mnemonic code.

Example:

* hexadecimal: 8a44dfd6ad4f687b5e3c80563c327027 
* mnemonic: "shade weave eternity kept true tangle new talk clay warmth fish match"
