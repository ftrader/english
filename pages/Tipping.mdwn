Bitcoin tipping is a new phenomenon and can sometimes be misconstrued as spam.  To avoid this, it's best to be aware of your environment.  For example, when tipping on certain Reddit thread, it is best to contribute a logical comment along with the tip.  

Remember, many people don't "get" bitcoin.  There's a chance many people never will, in which case bitcoin becomes more of a backend protocol.  Forcing bitcoin into people's faces isn't productive for anyone.
