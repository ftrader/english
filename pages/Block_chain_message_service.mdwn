**The service described on this page is long dead and defunct.**
<hr/>

A bitcoin based service to write messages into the bitcoin [[Block_chain]].
Each message is embedded into the bitcoin block chain using a [[Transaction]], providing the following properties:

* Message is kept inside the block-chain and it is therefore available forever.
* The message is copied to each existing bitcoin client in the world (currently order of 10^5 copies).
* A cryptographically signed timestamp as part of a bitcoin block serves as a proof that a message was written before that timestamp.
* Keeping the change left after message payment (the wallet private key) can be used as a proof for a message creation.

The protocol is open  (1.1)  (1.2), and open source tools for working with the protocol are available  (1.3)  (1.4).
Reading such bitcoin messages can be done online  (1.5) with the help of a [[Block_chain_browser]], or offline  (1.6) using a local copy of the block chain.
<b>Total anonymity</b> is possible both for message readers and message writers, when the [[Anonymity]] guidelines are kept.

For writing a new message, the client creates an email request and gives instructions for a specific bitcoin payment transactions (address and fee).
When the server gets the payment, it checks for the email request and processes the message.
The server is a special customised bitcoin setup behind [[Tor]].
