These votes are based on the proposals themselves, *not* the implementation thereof.
Therefore, voting is under the assumption of a mature implementation (eg, a few months of testing).

* No = not willing to consider as an option
* Very Weak = something new based on this is better than nothing at all
* Weak = better than nothing at all
* Yes = it is a workable solution
* Prefer = it is what he would choose if it was only up to him and no outside influences
