The Bitcoin Map is in fact a nameless project based on the analysis of addresses exchanged by bitcoin nodes.

Based on the collected informations, and by passing the collected IPs through Maxmind's GeoIP database, a map was created.

It was suggested on IRC to produce a map similar to torservers' one, using Google's kml format.

Then other resources were made available, including the number of online nodes.

## Bitcoin nodes over time

It is currently still unknown how reliable this information is. It represent the total number of unique IPs seen within the last 3 hours on the network.
