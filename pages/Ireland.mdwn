The Irish Bitcoin scene consists of a small number of bricks and morter retail stores, online merchants, and a small but growing community of enthusiasts.

##Bitcoin ATMs
There has been some controversy in relation to the installation of Bitcoin ATM's in Ireland, which has been covered in the broadsheet media. A pub in Dublin, formerly known as the Baggot Inn accepted bitcoin through a [[bitpay]] system for food and drink and shortly after hosted a bitcoin ATM  (2.1) in March 2014. However, the pub changed ownership, and the ATM was removed in October 2014  (2.2)

Separately in March 2014, GSM Solution's owned Bitvendo was due to place a Bitcoin ATM in a venue in Dublin's famous Temple Bar, but was refused an Irish bank account  (2.3)  which received considerable media coverage in print and radio. This was moved to the GSM Solutions shop in Abbey Street, and retired soon after from active service, although has been used in demonstrations. It was replaced by a Skyhook ATM which is currently in place. 

In February 2015, a second Skyhook ATM was installed by a separate owner in Busyfeet & Coco Cafe in South William Street  (2.4)  (2.5), in a bitcoin accepting café and bar that also uses [[bitpay]].

##Bitcoin Events
In July 2014, Bitcoin Finance (BitFin) 2014
