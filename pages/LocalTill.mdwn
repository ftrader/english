**LocalTill** was an anonymous merchant cash processing service based in the state of New York, that identifies deposits based on a unique code embedded in last digits of the deposit amount by adding a variable fee between 1% and 4%.

Localtill was used by [[Bitfloor]] in the USA, allowing users to make cash deposits (towards bitcoin purchases) at [[Bank_of_America]] branches using an "out of state deposit" slip. 

##Anonymity
LocalTill did not request any data identifying the user who makes the deposit. Bank of America was not requiring identification when customers made cash deposits, but CCTV footage was likely recorded.
