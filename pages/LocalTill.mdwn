**LocalTill** is an anonymous merchant cash processing service that authenticates deposits based on a unique code embedded in last digits of the deposit by adding a variable fee between 1% and 4%.

For example, a 500 USD deposit with a merchant may require the user to deposit 509.21 USD at a bank, whereby "9.21" is interpreted as a unique identifier for the deposit. No personal data is requested of the user who makes the deposit.

Localtill is used by [[Bitfloor]] in the USA, allowing users to make cash deposits (towards bitcoin purchases) at [[Bank_of_America]] branches using an out of state deposit slip. No identification is required. Bank of America tellers may ask for a phone number "for reference", which is actuality never used.
