Alternatively, to subscribe via email send an email to bitcoin-unofficial-alerts+subscribe@googlegroups.com [[mailto:bitcoin-unofficial-alerts+subscribe@googlegroups.com]].

If you receive an alert you should **immediately verify it is official** by running "bitcoind getinfo", go to [[http://www.bitcoin.org|bitcoin.org]] to find out more details concerning the alert, or join the #bitcoin IRC channel on freenode.
