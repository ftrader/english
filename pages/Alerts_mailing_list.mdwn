The Bitcoin [[Protocol_specification]] supports the broadcast of [[Alerts]]. An unofficial email relay is now provided that rebroadcasts these [[block_chain]] alerts via subscription to the bitcoin unofficial alert mailing list [(1)](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/bitcoin-unofficial-alerts). Alternatively, to subscribe via email send an email to bitcoin-unofficial-alerts+subscribe@googlegroups.com [(2)](mailto:bitcoin-unofficial-alerts+subscribe@googlegroups.com).

If you receive an alert you should **immediately verify it is official** by running "bitcoind getinfo", go to http://bitcoin.org [[http://www.bitcoin.org]] to find out more details concerning the alert, or join the #bitcoin IRC channel on freenode.

Alerts are independent of blocks or transactions, and have a defined time-to-live. The email relay polls bitcoind every 5 minutes and will continue to send alerts until the alert is cleared.

Please send any comments or requests to Gary Mulder [(3)](mailto:flyingkiwiguy@gmail.com).
