Browser based mining is the practice of utilizing web browsers as bitcoin miners through means of plugins or scripts.

## Introduction

This concept was first reached by Bitcoin Plus, a [[cpu miner|cpu-miner]] that is launched from the browser, requires no installation, and runs as a Java application. Additionally, this approach was done by [[Bitp.it|Bitp.it]] as javascript which is designed to be embeddable in webpages to create a distributed server farm.

##[[Bitcoin Plus|Bitcoin_Plus]] Implementation 

The miner connects to a pool and the payout method is pay-per-share.  The pool's fee is 3%.

Requires Java 1.5 or higher.  This miner app is not open source.

This software was announced on May 18, 2011 (3.1).

##[[Bitp.it|Bitp.it]] Implementation

A user's computer is used by the website they are viewing, which has added Javascript to the <head> section of the site, as a distributed miner. [[Slush's pool|Bitcoin_Pooled_Mining]] is used as the pool which the distributed computer connects to.
