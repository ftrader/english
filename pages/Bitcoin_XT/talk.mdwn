Hello, 

I think the last paragraph is not 100% correct ( "XT users will follow a new blockchain and cease to be using and trading bitcoins." )

only if there is a fork _without_ economic majority this would be the case. I tried to make it more factual but my edit got reverted,
maybe it was also not 100% correct, but the current text is also wrong and sounds like FUD imho.

> Hash power doesn't imply an economic majority. If a hash power majority decides on something that merchants don't recognize then the fork is completely irrelevant. ---[Lapp0](User:Lapp0) ([[talk|User_talk:Lapp0]])
