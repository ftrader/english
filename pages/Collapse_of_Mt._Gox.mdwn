**[[Mt._Gox]] halted trading** in February 2014 due to insolvency (1.1) after an apparently undetected theft that had been occurring since [[dollar_parity]]. The company said it was pausing withdrawal requests “to obtain a clear technical view of the currency processes”. The company issued a press release on February 10, 2014 stating that the issue was due to transaction malleability: “A bug in the bitcoin software makes it possible for someone to use the Bitcoin network to alter transaction details to make it seem like a sending of bitcoins to a bitcoin wallet did not occur when in fact it did occur. Since the transaction appears as if it has not proceeded correctly, the bitcoins may be resent. Mt. Gox is working with the Bitcoin core development team and others to mitigate this issue.” (1.2) (1.3)

On 17 February 2014, with all Mt. Gox withdrawals still halted and competing exchanges back in full operation, the company published another press release indicating the steps they claim they are taking to address security issues. (1.4) In an email interview with the *Wall Street Journal*, CEO Mark Karpelès refused to comment on increasing concerns among customers about the financial status of the exchange, did not give a definite date on which withdrawals would be resumed, and wrote that the exchange would impose "new daily and monthly limits" on withdrawals if and when they were resumed. (1.5) A poll of 3000 Mt. Gox customers by CoinDesk indicated that 68% of customers were still awaiting funds from Mt. Gox.  The median waiting time was between one to three months. 21% of poll respondents had been waiting for three months or more. (1.6)

On 20 February 2014, with all withdrawals still halted, Mt. Gox issued yet another statement, giving no date for the resumption of withdrawals. (1.7) A protest by two Bitcoin enthusiasts outside the building that houses the Mt. Gox headquarters in Tokyo continued. 
Citing "security concerns", Mt. Gox announced they had moved their offices to a different location in Shibuya. Bitcoin prices quoted by Mt. Gox dropped below 20% of the prices on other exchanges, reflecting the market's estimate of the unlikelihood of Mt. Gox paying their customers. (1.8) (1.9)

On 23 February 2014, Mark Karpelès, the CEO of Mt. Gox, resigned from the board of the [[Bitcoin_Foundation]]. (1.10) The same day, all posts on their Twitter account were removed. (1.11)

On 24 February 2014, Mt. Gox suspended all trading, and hours later its website went offline, returning a blank page. (1.12) An alleged leaked internal crisis management document claimed that the company was insolvent, after losing 744,408 bitcoins in a theft which went undetected for years. (1.13) (1.14) (1.15) (1.16) Six other major bitcoin exchanges released a joint statement distancing themselves from Mt. Gox, shortly before Mt. Gox's website went offline. (1.17) (1.18)

On 25 February 2014, Mt. Gox reported on its website that a "decision was taken to close all transactions for the time being", citing "recent news reports and the potential repercussions on MtGox's operations". The chief executive, Mark Karpelès told *Reuters* that Mt. Gox was "at a turning point". (1.19) (1.20) (1.21) (1.22)

On 28 February 2014 Mt. Gox filed for bankruptcy protection in Tokyo, reporting that it had liabilities of about 6.5 billion Japanese yen ($64 million at the time), and 3.84 billion yen in assets. (1.23) (1.24) The company said they had lost almost 750,000 of its customers' bitcoins, and around 100,000 of its own bitcoins, totaling around 7% of all bitcoins, and worth around $473 million near the time of the filing. Mt. Gox released a statement saying "The company believes there is a high possibility that the Bitcoins were stolen,” (1.25) blaming hackers, thus beginning a search for the missing money. Chief Executive of Mt. Gox, Mark Karpelès, said technical issues opened up the way for fraudulent withdrawals. 

Mt. Gox also faces lawsuits from its customers. (1.26) (1.27)

On 9 March 2014, Mt. Gox filed for bankruptcy protection in the US, to temporarily halt U.S. legal action by traders who alleged the operation was a fraud. (1.28) (1.29) (1.30)

On 20 March 2014, Mt. Gox reported on its website that it found some bitcoins — worth around $116 million — in an old digital wallet from 2011. That brings the total number of bitcoins the firm lost down to 650,000 from 850,000. (1.31)

On April 14, Mt. Gox lawyers said that Mark Karpeles wouldn't appear for a deposition in a Dallas court, or heed a subpoena by FinCEN. (1.32) 
On 16 April 2014, Mt. Gox gave up its plan to rebuild under bankruptcy protection, and asked a Tokyo court to allow it to be liquidated. (1.33)
