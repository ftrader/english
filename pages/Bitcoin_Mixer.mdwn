Why Us?

There have been a couple of similar services before, and as we see it, the problem with most of them was that they were not professional enough, not secure enough, and not taken seriously, thus becoming subjects to easy hacking and other problems. We on the other hand, are here for the long run. Our team consists of professional secure web application developers with 4-8 years experience, and we have built this solution from scratch with security being our number one concern.

The service is run on a dedicated server manually configured for this very purpose, which does publically connected from the internet (not needed if using Tor).
