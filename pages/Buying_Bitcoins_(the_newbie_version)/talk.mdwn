To other guy: You can have international section.

I'd like to add a section for Canadian Interac Online. Could I have edit rights?

## CoinTouch

I run [CoinTouch](https://www.cointouch.com/) (finds friends of friends that trade crypto currency). The site allows decentralised trading with trusted social network connections. I would like to update this page (and [[Getting_started]]) in order to include CoinTouch. Please could an admin do this, or grant me permission to do so.
