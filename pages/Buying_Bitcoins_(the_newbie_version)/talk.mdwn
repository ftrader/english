Hi! 

Could I add Brawker to this version? This is a very easy and different way of buying bitcoins. 

You can buy bitcoins using Paypal on Brawker.com. With Brawker you buy something at an online merchant for someone who is interested in paying with bitcoins. When the person receives the item, you receive the bitcoins that were held in escrow during the transaction. You can also pay for the item with a credit card.


-----------------------------

To other guy: You can have international section.

I'd like to add a section for Canadian Interac Online. Could I have edit rights?

## CoinTouch

I run [CoinTouch](https://www.cointouch.com/) (finds friends of friends that trade crypto currency). The site allows decentralised trading with trusted social network connections. I would like to update this page (and [[Getting_started]]) in order to include CoinTouch. Please could an admin do this, or grant me permission to do so.
