*Hey Mods, can you add the following to the 'Cash' section?... We have Bitcoin ATMs across Southern California and Las Vegas and we are expanding. I was thinking it might be a good idea to have a Bitcoin ATM section in here in addition to the 'cash' section. Bitcoin ATMs are n00b proof :P*

## Independent Reserve

Hello again!

Like the chaps at Brawker, I think you may not have seen my message further down the page, so I hope you don't mind me moving it here as I see it has worked for Brawker. :)

Our company, [Independent Reserve](https://www.independentreserve.com), is an Australian based Bitcoin exchange trading XBT/USD.  We allow international customers to transfer funds via SWIFT transfer into our USD trust account, and Australian customers can use BPAY.  Would appreciate a reference on the page if that's possible.

Hello again! 

I've tried to add Brawker before but I don't think you guys read my message further down. :(

Brawker is a very easy and different way of buying bitcoins. People can buy bitcoins using Paypal or credit card on [Brawker](https://www.brawker.com). With Brawker bitcoin buyers buy items at online merchants for people interested in paying with bitcoins. When they receive the items the bitcoin buyers receive the bitcoins that were held in escrow during each transaction.

Thank you!

Hi! 

Could I add Brawker to this version? This is a very easy and different way of buying bitcoins. 

You can buy bitcoins using Paypal on Brawker.com. With Brawker you buy something at an online merchant for someone who is interested in paying with bitcoins. When the person receives the item, you receive the bitcoins that were held in escrow during the transaction. You can also pay for the item with a credit card.

Thank you!

Dear Mods, 
Please can you submit the following entry to this page:

BANK TRANSFER > UK ONLY > BitcoinMagnet.co.uk

"allows customers to buy & sell Bitcoin automatically using their UK bank account. All you need to provide is an email address and either your bitcoin wallet address (if buying) or your bank account details (if selling). For buying, they give you a unique reference code to include with your bank transfer. All future transfers that include this code will be automatically converted to Bitcoin and sent to you. You can therefore set up a regular standing order if desired. For selling, they give you a unique Bitcoin deposit address to send coins to. All future payments to this address will be automatically converted to GBP and sent to your UK bank account. They use the latest Bitstamp market price and aim to complete orders within 10 minutes. The fee is currently 5%."

Many thanks,
John
