Pyramining is a Bitcoin Mining Farm that lets you borrow hashing power to mine for Bitcoins. You can mine Bitcoins without having to setting up a mining rig. All you have to do is join and send some Bitcoins to start. Once your account is active, miners will keep working for you until you are fully rewarded. A referral system is used to increase total system hashrate and revenues.

**How does it work?**

Join through one of the referral links on the twitter feed: https://twitter.com/Pyramining
Deposit any amount of Bitcoins to the provided address.
Optionally invite people to join through referral to increase your rewards.
Wait and profit.

**Is it a pyramid scheme?**

Not really. Rewards come entirely from Bitcoin mining, not by referral joining. The referral system is made only to increase your income and to increase hash rate by having more members.
