A distributed naming system based on Bitcoin technology.  

Namecoin uses a new blockchain, separate from the main Bitcoin chain.

Mining currently cannot be performed for multiple blockchains however changes to the Namecoin software may make it possible that a bitcoin miner can simultaneously mine the Namecoins.

The project was inspired by the bitdns discussion and recent failures of the DNS.

The open source software was announced on April 18, 2011 (1.1).
