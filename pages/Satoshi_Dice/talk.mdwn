#### DDoS claims
[[User:Luke-Jr]] added an edit to this article calling it a DDoS attack [in this revision](https://en.bitcoin.it/w/index.php?title=SatoshiDice&oldid=32544). Since I found the edit opinionated and it had no citations to back the accusation, I edited it to a more neutral form [in this revision](https://en.bitcoin.it/w/index.php?title=SatoshiDice&oldid=33157). He later reverted my edit [in this revision](https://en.bitcoin.it/w/index.php?title=SatoshiDice&oldid=33337) without revising the article. Since I have no intention of waging an edit war, I would like to hear Luke-Jr's opinion on the issue before making any further edits. Bitcoin doesn't need any more drama at this point.
