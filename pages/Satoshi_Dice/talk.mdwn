#### DDoS claims
[[User:Luke-Jr]] added an edit to this article calling it a DDoS attack [in this revision](https://en.bitcoin.it/w/index.php?title=SatoshiDice&oldid=32544). Since I found the edit opinionated and it had no citations to back the accusation, I edited it to a more neutral form [in this revision](https://en.bitcoin.it/w/index.php?title=SatoshiDice&oldid=33157). He later reverted my edit [in this revision](https://en.bitcoin.it/w/index.php?title=SatoshiDice&oldid=33337) without revising the article. Since I have no intention of waging an edit war, I would like to hear Luke-Jr's opinion on the issue before making any further edits. Bitcoin doesn't need any more drama at this point. --[Matoking](User:Matoking) ([[talk|User_talk:Matoking]]) 20:18, 5 December 2012 (GMT)

As to why I *don't* think SatoshiDice is a DDoS attack:

* SatoshiDice doesn't break any rules upheld by Bitcoin network since it pays transaction fees as seen in transactions such as [this](http://blockchain.info/tx/e774dbfad35e1bf5d9571f8d808b9a934130cc93c0ba2c6d70041c0fbb7f8fee) and [that one](http://blockchain.info/tx/d37cf4c63d6f4e1fc7fbce5f1f52447d514dc364bb13959aa6171be3635ae32f). More over, the transaction fees meet or exceed the minimum amount as described [[in this article|Transaction_fees]]. How can you claim SatoshiDice to be a DDoS attack when almost all of the miners deliberately include the transactions in their respective mined blocks since they don't "break" any rules?
* How SatoshiDice handles its bets and transactions is explained [here](http://satoshidice.com/bits.php) and the purported "transaction spam" is only a consequence of how the system works and how popular it has become, where the fault is more of poor design than malicious intent. The gamblers have knowledge of how the system works and just because it has become very active in terms of transaction throughput doesn't mean it has suddenly become a "DDoS attack" against the network. The same thing could be claimed about mixing services, which try to hide the transaction inputs' origins by shuffling them through multiple transactions, but since their effect on the size of blockchain is minimal at best, nobody seriously considers that they are malicious attacks.
* The reason why SatoshiDice works at the moment is because a lot of people legitimately use it for gambling and a lot of miners agree to include the created transactions in their blocks, since the inclusion of transaction fees make it viable. If most of people are okay with the service's existence, then why is it a DDoS attack? --[Matoking](User:Matoking) ([[talk|User_talk:Matoking]]) 09:59, 6 December 2012 (GMT)
