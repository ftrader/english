Facilitates direct discussions between bitcoin users.  

One purpose for this utility is to provide a way to communicate between parties of a transaction [out-of-band](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out-of-band).

A typical scenario is where an order was placed however insufficient information was provided to the seller when an order was placed to complete the transaction.  For example, consider the scenario where a customer entered an invalid e-mail address when the order was for the purchase of an online newsletter subscription.  In this instance, Bitcoin Contact could then be used a last-ditch effort to try to communicate with the customer.

Another scenario is to publicly express appreciation for an anonymous donation, which was the purpose of one of the first entries on the site (1.1)

Currently, all messages are visible publicly though private messages are being developed (1.2).

The site allows indexing by search engines, including Google.

The service was announced on February 23, 2011 (1.3).

##Criticism

The site is likely vulnerable to misrepresentation and impersonation.

For instance, because the EFF's donation address is [made public](https://www.eff.org/helpout#bitcoin), and transactions made to that address are [visible publicly](http://blockexplorer.com/address/1MCwBbhNGp5hRm5rC1Aims2YFRe2SXPYKt), a scammer might abuse Bitcoin Contact by posting a message as if it were coming from the EFF and targeted to the bitcoin addresses used to send a large donation to the EFF.
