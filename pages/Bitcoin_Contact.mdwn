Facilitates direct discussions between bitcoin users.  

One purpose for this utility is to provide a way to communicate between parties of a transaction [out-of-band](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out-of-band).

A typical scenario is where an order was placed however insufficient information was provided to the seller when an order was placed to complete the transaction.  For example, consider the scenario where a customer entered an invalid e-mail address when the order was for the purchase of an online newsletter subscription.  In this instance, Bitcoin Contact could then be used a last-ditch effort to try to communicate with the customer.

Another scenario is to publicly express appreciation for an anonymous donation, which was the purpose of one of the first entries on the site (1.1)

Currently, all messages are visible publicly though private messages are being developed (1.2).

The site allows indexing by search engines, including Google.

The service was announced on February 23, 2011/>[[!tag "Services"]]
1.1: [Thank for this donation](http://bitcoin-contact.org/?msg=19)  
1.2: [Todo](http://bitcoin-contact.org/?todo)
