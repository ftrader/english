What the hell?

You're saying to do ANY bitcoin/php website you need to:

+ Grab a special fork
+ Install the bcmath and gmp libraries into your web server


I think you're steering the 90+% of people who are NOT going to be using bitcoin for heavy-duty financial calculations the wrong way.  If I'm using PHP for a shopping cart application where the most complicated financial transaction I'm likely to need is ADDING, then using double-precision floating point for bitcoin amounts is 100% OK.

If you can find a PHP implementation on hardware that runs bitcoin AND stores numbers using too little precision to properly round amounts, let me know.

Otherwise:  you're making a mountain out of a molehill.
