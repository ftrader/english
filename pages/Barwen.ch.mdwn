The operator of barwen.ch wanted a project to play with Amazon's elastic compute cloud. barwen.ch is that project. 

According to barwen.ch, it provides:
> ...very low capacity shell accounts - a little bit of space (400mb per user), and a little bit of network bandwidth (280 bytes/sec, burstable up to 1mb and averaged over the whole month), and a little bit of CPU.

It can be used to keep a screen session with chat clients, or ping hosts, or run small robots and daemons and cron jobs, or plot mrtg graphs, etc.

Users will need to be running their own primary DNS servers so that barwen.ch server can load the zone from the users'.

The server is located in Ireland, in Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2). It supports IPv6 and DNSSEC.

> Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) is a web service that provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud. It is designed to make web-scale computing easier for developers.
