There already had been the [[Why_pooled_mining]] article though this article provides different information through a different presentation.

Should the original be merged into this one? - [Sgornick](User:Sgornick) 02:36, 24 May 2011 (GMT)

This article seems biased toward a) pooled mining and b) eligius. This would be fine on a page like Why Pooled Mining. But since this page indicates it has pros/cons of both, there should be pros/cons of both. As is, it almost sounds like a commercial for eligius. --[Hawks5999](User:Hawks5999) 19:04, 14 June 2011 (GMT)
