There already had been the [[Why_pooled_mining]] article though this article provides different information through a different presentation.

Should the original be merged into this one? - [Sgornick](User:Sgornick) 02:36, 24 May 2011 (GMT)

This article seems biased toward a) pooled mining and b) eligius. This would be fine on a page like Why Pooled Mining. But since this page indicates it has pros/cons of both, there should be pros/cons of both. As is, it almost sounds like a commercial for eligius. --[Hawks5999](User:Hawks5999) 19:04, 14 June 2011 (GMT)

Pooled mining is basically superior in every way nowadays, so there's not much one can do to avoid the "biased" feel. As for the Eligius bit, some other pool had a blatent advertisement in there, so I changed it to Eligius as a kind of "backfired!" expecting someone else to make it neutral fairly quick. --[Luke-jr](User:Luke-jr) 22:04, 14 June 2011 (GMT)
