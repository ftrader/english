An e-commerce business allowing payments and money transfers to be made from through the Internet.

TransferWise can send from either GBP funds (from U.K. bank account) or EUR funds (from a E.U. bank account) to one any of the supported destination currencies and will perform the currency conversion at mid-market rates. 

Currency directions (1.1):

* GBP - British sterling pound - Bank accounts in the UK from E.U. (EUR) bank transfers
* EUR - Euro - E.U. region banks from UK (GPB) bank transfers
* PLN - Polish zloty - Banks in Poland from UK (GBP) and E.U. (EUR) bank transfers
* CHF - Swiss Franc - Banks in Switzerland from UK (GBP) and E.U. (EUR) bank transfers.

The service is available for sending from an individual account or from a business account.

This ability to send directly to the recipient's bank will likely make TransferWise a preferred method that will allow those in the U.K. or E.U region to send funds when purchasing bitcoins through a person-to-person marketplace, such as the [[Bitcoin-otc]] marketplace.

The service was launched in early 2011.

##Fees

There is a 1 GBP fee per transfer.
