To protect against double spending, a transaction should not be considered as **confirmed** until a certain number of blocks in the block chain confirm, or verify that the transaction.  

The classic bitcoin client will show a transaction as "n/unconfirmed" until 6 blocks confirm the transaction.

Coins generated aren't confirmed for 100 blocks, and the classic bitcoin client won't show the generated coins as confirmed until the 120 block.
