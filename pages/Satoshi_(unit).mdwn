A **satoshi** is currently the smallest unit of the Bitcoin currency supported by the block chain (1/100,000,000 BTC or 0.00000001 BTC). The unit has been named "satoshi" in collective homage to the founder Bitcoin, [[Satoshi_Nakamoto]].

## Symbol

The Japanese characters サ ("sa") and シ ("shi") have been proposed as potential currency symbols for satoshi. (2.1)
