[[!img "SatoshiUsage.png" size=120x120 title="The term "satoshi" in use on a message board"]]A **satoshi** is currently the smallest unit of the bitcoin currency usable on the [[block_chain]]. (1.1) It is a one hundred millionth of a single bitcoin (0.00000001 BTC). (1.1) The unit has been named in collective homage to the original creator of Bitcoin, [[Satoshi_Nakamoto]].

All amounts in the block chain are denominated in satoshi before being converted for display. The source code also uses satoshi when specifying an amount of bitcoin.

##History
The value of a bitcoin in satoshi was decided by Satoshi Nakamoto to be 100 million no later than November 2008. (2.1)

On November 15, 2010, [[ribuck]] proposed that the one hundredth of a bitcoin (0.01 BTC) be called a *Satoshi*. (2.2) Four months later he instead suggested that the one hundred millionth unit be called an *austrian* or a *satoshi*. (2.3) The name *satoshi* caught on, and was widely adopted thereafter. (2.4)

##Usage
###Plural
Traditionally, the plural form has been simply *satoshi*, (4.1) but the term *satoshis* is also very prevalent. If the plural form were to follow the rules of Japanese grammar, it may be pronounced as *satoshi*, (4.2) *satoshisa*, (4.2) or *satoshi-tachi*. (4.3)

###Symbol
Satoshi is sometimes abbreviated to *sat* or *s*.

The Japanese character シ ("**shi**") has been proposed as a potential currency symbol for the satoshi. (5.1) The Katakana symbol サ ("**sa**") has also been proposed, as it looks more reminiscent of a currency symbol. (5.2) (5.3) The circled shi (㋛) has been suggested to disambiguate the symbol from the character, (5.4) (5.5) as it is synonymous with death. (5.6) (5.7) Additionally, the Hiragana shi (し) is a suggestion. (5.7) (5.8)
