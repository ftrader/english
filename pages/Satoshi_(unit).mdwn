[[!img "SatoshiUsage.png" size=120x120 title="The term "satoshi" in use on a message board"]]A **satoshi** is currently the smallest unit of the bitcoin currency usable on the [[block_chain]]. (1.1) It is a one hundred millionth of a single bitcoin (0.00000001 BTC). (1.1) The unit has been named in collective homage to the original creator of Bitcoin, [[Satoshi_Nakamoto]].

All amounts in the block chain are denominated in satoshi before being converted for display. The source code also uses satoshi when specifying an amount of bitcoin.

##Usage
###Plural
Traditionally, the plural form has been simply *satoshi*, (3.1) but the term *satoshis* is also very prevalent. If the plural form were to follow the rules of Japanese grammar, it may be pronounced as *satoshi*, (3.2) *satoshisa*, (3.2) or *satoshi-tachi*. (3.3) Other alternatives, including *satoshii*, (3.4) have been suggested.

###Symbol
Satoshi is sometimes abbreviated to *sat.* or *s*.

The Japanese character シ ("**shi**") has been proposed as a potential currency symbol for the satoshi. (4.1) The Katakana symbol サ ("**sa**") has also been proposed, as it looks more reminiscent of a currency symbol. (4.2) (4.3) The circled shi (㋛) has been suggested to disambiguate the symbol from the character, (4.4) (4.5) as it is synonymous with death. (4.6) (4.7) Additionally, the Hiragana shi (し) is a suggestion. (4.7) (4.8)

More elaborate and meaningful symbols have been considered, including 聡, (4.9) the [kanji](wikipedia:kanji) designated to Satoshi Nakamoto. (4.10) 龘, literally "the appearance of a dragon taking flight", has also been suggested. (4.11) However, it is unlikely that an overly complicated symbol would be adopted. (4.9)
