It is a one hundred millionth of a single bitcoin (0.00000001 BTC). The unit has been named in collective homage to the original creator of Bitcoin, [[Satoshi_Nakamoto]].

All amounts in the block chain are denominated in satoshi before being converted for display. The source code also uses satoshi when specifying an amount of bitcoin.

##Usage
###Plural
Traditionally, the plural form has been simply *satoshi*, but the term *satoshis* is also very prevalent. If the plural form were to follow the rules of Japanese grammar, it may be pronounced as *satoshi*, (3.1) *satoshisa*, (3.1) or *satoshi-tachi*. (3.2)

###Symbol
The Japanese character シ ("**shi**") has been proposed as a potential currency symbol for the satoshi. (4.1) The Katakana symbol サ ("**sa**") has also been proposed, as it looks more reminiscent of a currency symbol. (4.2) (4.3)
