[BitcoinX.io](http://bitcoinx.io/) is a community review and ratings service for Bitcoin exchanges and Bitcoin wallets that launched in 2014  (1.1). There are literally hundreds of exchanges and wallets across the world, so itâ€™s hard for people to keep track of all of them, and know which ones are reputable or not. BitcoinX keeps track of all of the Bitcoin exchanges and wallets and allows the Bitcoin Community to rate them and review them, and displays them into a top rated Bitcoin Exchange and Wallet ranking system.

Other services include a [real-time price ticker and chart](http://bitcoinx.io/price/), and other charts such as a Bitcoin Market Capitalization chart, [news and price widgets](http://bitcoinx.io/bitcoin-price-widgets/), and Bitcoin informational resources.
