The **Softfork Wishlist** is to record changes to Bitcoin that might be desirable, but that will require a [["soft" block-chain split|Softfork]] (consensus of the miners).

This page is *not* for changes that require a [["hard" block-chain split|Hardfork]] (everybody must upgrade, old software will not accept blocks/transactions created with the new [[rules|Protocol_rules]], considering them to be [[invalid blocks|Invalid_block]]).
