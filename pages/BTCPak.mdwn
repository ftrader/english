[BTCPak](https://www.btcpak.com) was a service to exchange your [[Bitcoins]] for [[MoneyPak]].  The service required the user to select the denomination of MoneyPak they would like to receive and provide a [[bitcoin_address]] in case a refund is necessary.


The user was then provided with a [[bitcoin_address]] to send the provided number of [[Bitcoins]].  After six network confirmations, the user was presented with the [[MoneyPak]] code.  If the user deposits using a [[GreenAddress]] from [[MtGox]] or [[Instawallet]], the [[MoneyPak]] code was available immediately.
