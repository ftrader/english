A list of devices which are able to run recent versions of Bitcoin Core.
Note that these devices have *not* been tested to meet (currently undetermined) minimum specifications.

## Desktop/Laptops

* All Intel architecture 32-bit and 64-bit PCs and Macs.  Pre-compiled executables are available from [Bitcoin.org](https://bitcoin.org/en/download) for Windows, OS X, and most popular Linuxes.  Users can compile executables for other Linuxes and the BSD-derived operating systems.

## ARM-based Chipsets

* Raspberry Pi v1 running Raspbian or another Linux (3.1), although it will run very slowly and the initial block chain sync may take more than a week.

* Raspberry Pi v2 running Raspbian or another Linux (3.2).  Being about six times faster than the original RPi, it has the potential to be much more usable.

* ODroid U2 running Linux, although it's "not reliable due to thermal issues" (3.3)

* Novena (Cortex A9) running Linux (3.3)
