PoolServerJ is a pure java implementation of a Bitcoin mining pool server.  Itâ€™s functionally very similar to pushpoold.  Although there are some differences it is capable of being swapped over with pushpoold without any config changes.

####Features

* Native merged mining support.  Will work with standard bitcoind 0.5
* SCrypt blockchain support
* Customisable coinbase transaction (pay block rewards to any wallet perhaps an offline secure wallet)
* Internal work generation (more than 10x faster than rpc getwork)
* Work caching - caches work from bitcoind or internal WorkMaker to handle short term spikes in requests
* Database resilience.  Server can keep running if database goes down and shares will be sent to database when connection is reestablished
* DoS resilience with QoS support to ensure workers who've submitted valid work are serviced with priority
* Capable of pulling work from multiple bitcoin daemons to get around the getwork bottleneck and also to provide some redundancy
* Notify of block change via HTTP to a user configurable URL to support event triggered share processing
* Cached database handling (optional) to reduce round trips.
* Supports Mysql, Postgresql, sqlite3 (JDBC based so others can be added easily - currently only tested on mysql)
* Runs as a Windows service
* Longpolling support
* Integrated block monitoring using all available bitcoin daemon work sources
* Dump shares to Database, log file or stdout
* Safe restart - shares issued to client are dumped to file on shutdown and reloaded on startup so your miners won't get stale shares if you restart a live server
* Only dependency is a Java 6+ JDK.
