Author: [witchspace](User:witchspace)

##Features

* Compatibility with Linux (both GNOME and KDE), MacOSX and Windows
* All functionality of the original client
* User friendly, tabbed interface
* Asks for confirmation before sending coins
* CSV export of transactions
* Clearer transaction list with status icons and real-time filtering

##Current version
Source code (and build instructions for supported platforms) can be found at the [Github page](https://github.com/laanwj/bitcoin-qt). There is currently (2011-07-07) no installer or binary build as the project is still changing too fast to warrant releases.
