**Bitcoin-Qt** is the third [[Bitcoin]] [[client|Clients]], developed by [[Wladimir_J._van_der_Laan]] based on the original reference code by [[Satoshi_Nakamoto]]. (1.1) (1.2) (1.3) It has been bundled with [[bitcoind]] since version 0.5. (1.4)

##History

Bitcoin-Qt can used as a desktop client for regular payments or as a server utility for merchants and other payment services. 

###Current version
Source code (and build instructions for supported platforms) can be found at the [Bitcoin GitHub page](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin).

* Compatibility with Linux (both GNOME and KDE), Mac OS X and Windows
* All functionality of the original wxWidgets client
* Asks for confirmation before sending coins

* Sendmany support in UI (send to multiple recipients in one transaction)
* Multiple [[unit|Units]] support, can show subdivided bitcoins (mBTC, ÂµBTC) for users that like large numbers (only decimal units)
* Splash screen that details progress

##Criticism
Bitcoin-Qt is often criticized for being slow in downloading and verifying the Bitcoin transaction database (often called the Blockchain).  

It has also been criticized for hogging one's upload bandwidth when peers connect to download the blockchain.  This issue has been [discussed extensively on GitHub](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/273).  Windows users can work around this issue [by downloading Netbalancer](http://seriousbit.com/netbalancer/) and throttling bitcoin-qt's upload bandwidth to ensure that one has enough upload bandwidth available for regular computer and internet use to be unaffected.

Wallet management is also cumbersome. Unlike clients such as [[Armory]], [[MultiBit]], [[Electrum]] and others only one wallet at a time is supported, and its location is required to be the same as the blockchain storage, making it [[difficult to place the wallet on an encrypted drive|Securing_your_wallet#Making_a_secure_workspace]].
