## Protect main page

The main page is the perfect opportunity for vandalism. Although having it unprotected allows everyone to improve it (which is uncommon), the risk is too great when the edit could just be done by an administrator. [X](User:X) 11:27, 7 January 2012 (GMT)

## A bit cleanup ok?

Hi, during my learing phase esp. next week I would like to do some minor cleanups on the wiki (categorization, Renaming, formating, ...) as I guess it might be wise if somebody with a fresh mind would take a look on the articles. Is that ok for you or is this wiki a bit more 'discuss first and edit after that' ? --[MandM](User:MandM) 14:10, 13 February 2012 (GMT)
