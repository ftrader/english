##Further Languages

There now are wiki URLs here for two languages in addition to English.  How do bitcoin wikis for additional languages get started?   For example, there are a number of bitcoin users whose primary language is spanish.  Bitcoin has a number of German language readers too ... for example [[http://www.go-bitcoin.com_Go-Bitcoin]].

## Contents of "Topic central"
I suggest adding "services". [Phelix](User:Phelix) 12:30, 15 September 2011 (GMT)

This link should be displayed more prominently. Maybe something like: "spend coins". Also "trade" is very misleading because it is easy to think of trading bitcoins on an exchange but not buying goods and services.
