The description of bitcoin is similiar to wikipedia article.--[Kiba](User:Kiba) 19:53, 16 December 2010 (GMT)
>  It seems that the beginning of the introduction was made by Grondilu (french guy who sometimes comes on irc and auctions gold on the forum), see [(1)](http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bitcoin&diff=402269158&oldid=402260422). Since most of the bitcoin article on wikipedia was put together by the bitcoin community, it shouldn't be too difficult to have them accept publication here. In the meantime I see no harm keeping this for a few days, until we either get explicit authorization, or rewrite it into something more personnal.

I don't like  "the idea of using digital files as money" -- maybe "the idea of using digital information as money" ?  'files' has too specific a meaning in the computer context. Then again, most dollars and euros and other conventional currency are nothing but accounting entries in various databases.--[Gavin Andresen](User:Gavinandresen) 16:20, 22 December 2010 (GMT)
