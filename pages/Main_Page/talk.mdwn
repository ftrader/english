The description of bitcoin is similiar to wikipedia article.--[Kiba](User:Kiba) 19:53, 16 December 2010 (GMT)
>  It seems that the beginning of the introduction was made by Grondilu (french guy who sometimes comes on irc and auctions gold on the forum), see [(1)](http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bitcoin&diff=402269158&oldid=402260422). Since most of the bitcoin article on wikipedia was put together by the bitcoin community, it shouldn't be too difficult to have them accept publication here. In the meantime I see no harm keeping this for a few days, until we either get explicit authorization, or rewrite it into something more personnal.

I don't like  "the idea of using digital files as money" -- maybe "the idea of using digital information as money" ?  'files' has too specific a meaning in the computer context. Then again, most dollars and euros and other conventional currency are nothing but accounting entries in various databases.--[Gavin Andresen](User:Gavinandresen) 16:20, 22 December 2010 (GMT)
>  Maybe using with "bits of data"? (it's BITcoin after all). Anyway "files" doesn't seem appropriate... [MagicalTux](User:MagicalTux) 12:25, 23 December 2010 (GMT)
> "bits of data" sounds equally weird. I changed it to information. However, is it really information? Information is supposed to be human-readable quantitative data, whereas data is the raw stream... It doesn't fit data or information as it's a solution to a mathematical operation. We could write "the idea of using computed solutions to mathematical problems as money". [Genjix](User:Genjix) 16:38, 23 December 2010 (GMT)

## Header capitalisation

Please refrain from using Initial Caps in your titles. Use One initial cap... It's the style in current usage.
For names such as Bitcoin Market, capitalise each letter of the word only for that name.
e.g "How to use Bitcoin Market"[Genjix](User:Genjix) 07:23, 30 December 2010 (GMT)

## Fonts for source code

MT, can you make the fonts bigger? I can hardly see the fonts for the &lt;source&gt; snippets. Thanks. [Genjix](User:Genjix) 07:23, 30 December 2010 (GMT)
