There are two variations of the official bitcoin program available; one with a graphical user interface (usually referred to as just “Bitcoin”), and a 'headless' version (called [[bitcoind]]). They are completely compatible with each other, and take the same command-line arguments, read the same configuration file, and read and write the same data files. You can run one copy of either Bitcoin or bitcoind on your system at a time (if you accidently try to launch another, the copy will let you know that Bitcoin or bitcoind is already running and will exit).

__TOC__
##Command-line arguments

Give Bitcoin (or bitcoind) the -? or –-help argument and it will print out a list of the most commonly used command-line arguments and then exit:

Usage:
	bitcoin [[options]]                     
	bitcoin [[options]] <command> [[params]]  Send command to -server or bitcoind
	bitcoin [[options]] help                List commands

	-gen               Generate coins
	-gen=0             Don't generate coins
	-min               Start minimized
	-datadir=<dir>     Specify data directory

	-rpcport=<port>    Listen for JSON-RPC connections on <port> (default: 8332)
	-rpcallowip=<ip>   Allow JSON-RPC connections from specified IP address
	-rpcconnect=<ip>   Send commands to node running on <ip> (default: 127.0.0.1)
	-keypool=<n>       Set key pool size to <n> (default: 100)
	-rescan            Rescan the block chain for missing wallet transactions
SSL-Options:

	-rpcsslciphers=<ciphers>                 Acceptable ciphers (default: TSLv1+HIGH:!SSLv2:!aNULL:!AH:!3DES:@STRENGTH)
	-?                 This help message
Additional (Supported but not listed in -? help):
	-daemon            Run in the background as a daemon and accept commands
	-checkblocks       Rescan the whole blockchain (can take very much time)

##Bitcoin.conf Configuration File
All command-line options (except for -datadir and -conf) may be specified in a configuration file, and all configuration file options may also be specified on the command line. Command-line options override values set in the configuration file.

The configuration file is a list of setting=value pairs, one per line, with optional comments starting with the '#' character.

The configuration file is not automatically created; you can create it using your favorite plain-text editor. By default, Bitcoin (or bitcoind) will look for a file named 'bitcoin.conf' in the bitcoin [[data_directory]], but both the data directory and the configuration file path may be changed using the -datadir and -conf command-line arguments.


|Windows|%APPDATA%\Bitcoin\|(XP) C:\Documents and Settings\username\Application Data\Bitcoin\bitcoin.conf(Vista, 7) C:\Users\username\AppData\Roaming\Bitcoin\bitcoin.conf
|Linux|$HOME/.bitcoin/|/home/username/.bitcoin/bitcoin.conf
|Mac OSX|$HOME/Library/Application Support/Bitcoin/|/Users/username/Library/Application Support/Bitcoin/bitcoin.conf


##Sample Bitcoin.conf
Here is a sample bitcoin.conf file, containing every option set to its default value.

	# bitcoin.conf configuration file. Lines beginning with # are comments.
	
	
	# Network-related settings:
	
	# Run on the test network instead of the real bitcoin network.
	#testnet=1
	
	# Connect via a socks4 proxy
	#proxy=127.0.0.1:9050

	##            Quick Primer on addnode vs connect            ##
	##  Let's say for instance you use addnode=4.2.2.4          ##
	##  addnode will connect you to and tell you about the      ##
	##    nodes connected to 4.2.2.4.  In addition it will tell ##
	##    the other nodes connected to it that you exist so     ##
	##    they can connect to you.                              ##
	##  connect will not do the above when you 'connect' to it. ##
	##    It will *only* connect you to 4.2.2.4 and no one else.##
	##                                                          ##
	##  So if you're behind a firewall, or have other problems  ##
	##  finding nodes, add some using 'addnode'.                ##
	##                                                          ##
	##  If you want to stay private, use 'connect' to only      ##
	##  connect to "trusted" nodes.                             ##
	##                                                          ##
	##  If you run multiple nodes on a LAN, there's no need for ##
	##  all of them to open lots of connections.  Instead       ##
	##  'connect' them all to one node that is port forwarded   ##
	##  and has lots of connections.                            ##
	##       Thanks goes to [[Noodle]] on Freenode.               ##

##Platforms
###Windows

####Start automatically
To configure the Bitcoin client to start automatically:

You might use the configuration-file, or the GUI-Settings:

Settings -> Options

then mark the checkbox titled:
	[[X]] Start Bitcoin on system startup

[[!template id=ns:file]][[:Client_Settings_Options_windows.png]]

####Batch automation
To work with batch, you have to start the daemon (bitcoind.exe). The bitcoin.exe run with option "-server" will respond with GUI-messages you are not able to process its answers.
