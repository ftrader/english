An orphan block is a block that doesn't have a known parent in the longest [[block_chain]].

Not to be confused with a [[Stale Block|Vocabulary#Stale_Block]], which is a well-formed block which is no longer part of the difficultywise-longest and well-formed blockchain.

The [[Block_Reward]] in a stale block is no longer spendable on the difficultywise-longest and well-formed blockchain; therefore whoever mined that block does not actually get the reward (or the [[transaction_fees]]).  This phenomenon must be taken into account by mining pools that use any payout strategy other than "proportional".
