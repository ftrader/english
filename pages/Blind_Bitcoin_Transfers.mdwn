A [[mixing_service]] which is an implementation of David Chaum's blind digital cash scheme.

Client-side cryptography is done in the browser. 

##History

This service was first seen in June, 2011.  In August, 2011 the site displayed the message:
	Closed for the foreseeable future
	Somebody found an exploit in the code on this site. I am working on finding it, but, in the meantime, I have decided to get out of this business.

##Fees

When transferring funds to the service, a fee is added.  Though there was no fee schedule found on the site various amounts were used and the fee appears to be a flat 0.02 BTC per transfer.
