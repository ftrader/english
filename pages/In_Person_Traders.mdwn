This page is a map of people trading bitcoins in person in the real world. (Person to Person transactions) These are usually done using cash. If you have no bitcoins and are new to this, the trader is likely able to help you with the transaction and setting up a wallet.

Feel free to add yourself to the map by editing this page, and include some form of contact information. Also, you can include the calculation for your buy/sell prices and how much you are willing to buy/sell. <br/>
