It would be really nice if someone could research historical presidents as to whether bitcoins should be classified as non-functional currency (like foreign currency) or stored value like gold or silver, or possibly something else entirely like a poker chip.   So far I think most of the text assumes bitcoins should be treated as stored value for tax purposes.
