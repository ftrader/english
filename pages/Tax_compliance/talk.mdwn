It would be really nice if someone could research historical presidents as to whether bitcoins should be classified as non-functional currency (like foreign currency) or stored value like gold or silver, or possibly something else entirely like a poker chip.   So far I think most of the text assumes bitcoins should be treated as stored value for tax purposes.

* The US government, at least, has already declared Bitcoins to be stored value. --[Luke-jr](User:Luke-jr) 21:47, 15 June 2011 (GMT)
