*Business Model*

Bit-Hosts business model is to resell so-called share-hosting or OCH(One-Click Hoster) accounts for bitcoin. While most of the regular customers in this business have an increased need for anonymity, none of those hosters accepts Bitcoin so far. Bit-Host tries to fill that gap by allowing customers to not only save money but also pay in bitcoin and receive their accounts instantaneously.

*Operation*

Bit-Host was founded in 2012. It features a live, instant order system as well as automated bitcoin deposits.
