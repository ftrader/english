[CasinoBitco.in Bitcoin Casino and Bitcoin Sportsbook](http://www.casinobitco.in) is one of the oldest and most established bitcoin casino and sportsbook sites, originally started in 2013 and serving over a million lifetime games as of March 2015. It was the first Provably Fair Bitcoin Casino which also offered users a fully operational Bitcoin Sportsbook. Originating funding on Havelock Investments, CasinoBitco.in acquired both Bit777.com and Peerbet.org in February of 2014.

##History
CasinoBitco.in was founded in early 2013 by a team of crypto enthusiasts with the goal of creating a premier destination for bitcoin gambling, sports betting, and casino gaming.  In order to raise initial bankroll and development funding for the site, funds were raised on the Havelock Investments platform in September 2013. CasinoBitco.in has traded at a market cap as high as 17,500 bitcoin during the fall of 2013. 

By offering best-in-class odds, loading speed, provably-fair offerings, and mobile functionality, CasinoBitco.in is designed to appeal to the BTC gambler looking for the most fun and reliable experience on the market. 

With analysts estimating the bitcoin gambling space to surpass 2 billion in annual gambling handle/turnover by 2016, CasinoBitco.in is poised to be at the top of itâ€™s game as bitcoin and crytpocurrency gambling grows beyond 1% of global iGaming market share by 2017.

##Software
CasinoBitco.in's software was developed internally by a small team of engineers and UX designers focussed on creating an intuitive and engaging gaming experience in the emerging Bitcoin sector. Backend technologies include PHP, MySQL, and nodeJS and the entire front end site was redesigned in early 2015 to be 100% responsive so that users can play on both their desktop and smartphones without losing any gaming quality.
