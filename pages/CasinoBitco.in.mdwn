##Software
CasinoBitco.in's software was developed internally by a small team of engineers and UX designers focussed on creating an intuitive and engaging gaming experience in the emerging Bitcoin sector. Backend technologies include PHP, MySQL, and nodeJS and the entire front end site was redesigned in early 2015 to be 100% responsive so that users can play on both their desktop and smartphones without losing any gaming quality.
