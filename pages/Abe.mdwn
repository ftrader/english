**Abe** is a free, open-source [[block_chain_browser]] released by [John Tobey](User:JohnTobey253) under the [Affero General Public License](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affero_General_Public_License).

Written in [Python](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_%28programming_language%29) and portable [SQL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL), (1.1) Abe draws inspiration from [[Bitcoin_Block_Explorer]] and seeks some level of compatibility with it but uses a completely new implementation. (1.2)
