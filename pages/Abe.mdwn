**Abe** is a free, open-source [[block_chain_browser]] released by [John Tobey](User:JohnTobey253) under the [Affero General Public License](wikipedia:Affero General Public License).

Written in [Python](wikipedia:Python (programming language)) and portable [SQL](wikipedia:SQL), (1.1) Abe draws inspiration from [[Bitcoin_Block_Explorer]] and seeks some level of compatibility with it but uses a completely new implementation. (1.2)
