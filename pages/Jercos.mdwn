**Jeremy Sturdivant** (**jercos**) was the counter-party to [[Laszlo_Hanyecz]] in the first documented purchase of a tangible good or service using bitcoin. On May 22, 2010 Laszlo Hanyecz famously declared success in his four day quest to trade 10,000 BTC for “a couple of pizzas”, posting on a [bitcointalk forum page](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=137.msg1195#msg1195):
	
“I just want to report that I successfully traded 10,000 bitcoins for pizza.
Thanks jercos!”

According to jercos the transaction was finalized over IRC chats.
Jercos was 18 at the time of the transaction. 
At one time in late 2013 10,000 bitcoins was worth over USD$12million.
