The term [money supply](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_supply) refers 
to the total amount of money in circulation in an economy. 

##Central banks

In a centralized economy, currency is issued by a central bank, at a rate 
that is supposed to match the growth of the amount of physical goods that 
are exchanged, so that these goods can be traded with stable prices. The 
money supply is controlled by the central bank, mostly via its interest 
rates. Lowering the interest rates tends to increase the money supply ; 
raising them tends to decrease the money supply.

##Decentralized currency

If the currency emission system is fully decentralized, there is no central authority that regulates the amount of currency in
circulation. Instead, currency is created by the nodes of a peer-to-peer network. It is therefore necessary to define in advance 
how currency will be created, and to build the creation rules into the protocol used by the nodes of the network. 

###Finite supply and deflation

Satoshi Nakamoto's answer to this problem has been to authorize the creation of a finite 
amount of Bitcoins. Bitcoins are created each time a user discovers a new [[block]]. 
The rate of block creation is set to be approximately constant over time. However, the 
number of Bitcoins generated per block is set to decrease geometrically, at a rate of 
approximately 50% every 4 years. The result is that the amount of Bitcoins created will 
never exceed 21 million. 

A consequence of finite supply is that economic growth will cause price deflation : 
the value of Bitcoins will increase when more goods and services are traded using them.

However, there are economic arguments against [[deflation|Deflationary_spiral]] ; 
in particular, deflation tends to reward the people who save their coins instead 
of spending or investing them, and it does not favor trade and wealth redistribution. 

###Controlled inflation

There is no theoretical reason why a peer-to-peer and decentralized currency emission system 
should use a limited amount of currency. Instead, the limited money supply of Bitcoin seems 
to be a choice of its creator. It is not a limitation of peer-to-peer currencies.

It would be possible to create a variant of Bitcoin with a controlled inflation rate. 
Instead of geometrically decreasing the amount of coins attributed to new blocks, this 
amount would be increased each year, at a predefined rate.

For example, if the initial value of a block is 50 coins, and if 
the increase rate is 2%, then the money supply would increase as 
follows:


|year |value of new blocks |(money supply)/(new blocks per year)|money supply increase (%)
|0    |50.00 |50.00|- 
|1    |51.00|101.00 |102.00%
|2    |52.02 |153.02|51.50%
|3    |53.06|206.08|34.68%
|...    |...|...|...
|10    |60.95|608.43|11.13%
|100|362.23|15973.84|2.32%


As the money supply grows, its rate of increase will tend towards the rate used to increase 
the value of new blocks (2% in this example). The increase of the money supply is not decided 
by a central authority or government; instead it is known in advance, and economic agents can 
integrate it to their expectations.

####Choice of the increase rate

It is important to note that the choice of a predefined increase rate does not guarantee that 
deflation will never occur; if the economy grows faster than the money supply, price deflation 
might still be observed. 

In theory, it would be possible to create several currencies with various 
increase rates, and to let markets decide their relative values ; in practice, however, having to 
deal with multiple currencies might be confusing and unpractical.
