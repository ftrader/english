__TOC__

In a centralized economy, currency is issued by a central bank, at a rate 
that is supposed to match the growth of the amount of physical goods that 
are exchanged, so that these goods can be traded with stable prices. The 
<span class="plainlinks">[money supply](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_supply)</span> is controlled by a central bank through <span class="plainlinks">[Open Market Operations](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_market_operations)</span>. In the United States, the <span class="plainlinks">[Fed](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_System)</span> sets the <span class="plainlinks">[Federal Funds](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Funds_Rate)</span> rate, and more recently, prints money electronically in a process called <span class="plainlinks">[Quantitative Easing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_easing)</span>.

In a fully decentralized monetary system, there is no central authority that regulates the amount of currency incirculation. Instead, currency is created by the nodes of a peer-to-peer network. The Bitcoin generation algorithm defines, in advance, how currency will be created and at what rate. Any currency that is generated by a malicious user that does not follow the rules will be rejected by the network and thus is worthless.

##Currency with Finite Supply

[[!img "total_bitcoins_over_time_graph.png" size=120x120 title="Number of bitcoins over time"]]

Bitcoins are created each time a user discovers a new [[block]]. 
The rate of block creation is approximately constant over time: 6 per hour. The 
number of Bitcoins generated per block is set to decrease geometrically, at a rate of 
50% every 4 years. The result is that the number of Bitcoins in existence will 
never exceed 21 million (2.1).

##Inflation and Deflation

While the number of bitcoins in existence will never exceed 21 million, the [money supply](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_supply) of bitcoins can greatly exceed 21 million due to [Fractional-reserve Banking](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractional-reserve_banking). So while the limited number of "hard" bitcoins will cause deflation in the long term due to positive non-zero reserve requirements, a fast increase in the money supply due to an adoption of Fractional-reserve banking can cause inflation in the medium term.

Worth noting are the Keynesian economic arguments against [[deflation|Deflationary_spiral]]; such that deflation tends to reduce profits and hence provides a dis-incentive for entrepreneurs to continue their operations. The <span class="plainlinks">[Austrian school](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austrian_School)</span> of thought adequately counters this theory, as deflation occurs in all stages of production and entrepreneurs also benefit from it. As a result, profit ratios tend to stay the same, only their magnitudes change. In other words, in a deflationary environment, goods and services decrease in price, but at the same time the cost for the production of these goods and services tend to decrease proportionally, effectively not affecting profits at all.

Price deflation encourages an increase in hoarding - hence savings - which in turn tends to lower interest rates and increase the incentive for entrepreneurs to invest in projects of longer term.
