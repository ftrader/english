**Bitcoin Darts** is a virtual dart board where the darts position is based on a random number that is generated.  

Amounts wagered can be as low as 0.01 BTC though losses could occur due to a rounding error for winning amounts when the amount wagered is under 0.1 BTC.

A forum contributor calculated the odds of winning or breaking even at 42.61%, and the chances of losing at 58.33%. (1.1).  The site has been available since September 20, 2010 (1.2).
