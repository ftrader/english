This is a node list, taken from [the original wiki](http://www.bitcoin.org/wiki/doku.php?id=fallback_nodes).

The nodes list will be updated every hour by [WikiBot](User:WikiBot) to show the status of the network. You are not allowed to add an ip which is not yours here. A node offline for more than 48 hours will be removed from the listing automatically.

## Adding a node

Before adding yourself as a fallback node, you should be sure your node will stay online for a long time. If a node is offline for more than 24 hours it will be removed from the list.

To add a node in this list, you just need the ip/hostname and your name, the other fields will be filled automatically. Insert the following lines before the <tt>END NODELIST</tt> line:

	<nowiki>|-
| ip || your name</nowiki>

Please note that a bot will connect to your node every hour to check its status and version.
