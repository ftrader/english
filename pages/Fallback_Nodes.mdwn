This is a list of nodes which are considered reliable. <del>Nodes from this list which are down for more than 24 hours will be automatically removed and status of each node is displayed and updated every hour by [WikiBot](User:WikiBot) </del>.
**Wikibot is currently malfunctioning and is incorrectly marking nodes running version 0.6 as being down**.

## How to use this list

### Connect to nodes

You can connect to these nodes with the *-addnode=ip* switch instead of the usual node harvesting process (through IRC or via the embedded nodelist). You can connect to more than one node by using *-addnode=ip* more than once. It is usually a good idea to connect to more than one of these nodes.

#### Nodes without a fixed ip

If the node IP is not fixed (see "Fixed" column), you will have to resolve the node's name (first column) each time the IP changes. Some nodes may have their ip change once a day, some others once a month, and some others may stay on the same IP for years. Still, as long as the IP is not fixed, there is no guarantee it will stay the same.

In order to enable hostname lookups for the *-addnode* and *-connect* parameters, you must additionally provide the *-dns* parameter. Example:
	bitcoind -dns -addnode=bitcoin.es

Versions prior to 0.3.22 do not support hostnames to the *-addnode* parameter, so you must do the resolving part for it. For example on linux:
	bitcoind -addnode=$(dig +short bitcoin.es)

### IP Transactions

You can also send [[IP_Transactions]] to these nodes. If you include your bitcoin address in the "message" field, you may have your coins back.

### Tor network

To use tor .onion addresses ([[listed below|Fallback_Nodes#Tor_nodes]]), you will need to map virtual ips via the *torrc* file:

	mapaddress 192.0.2.2 ijzt2eeizty3p5xe.onion
	mapaddress 192.0.2.3 j43z65b6r2usg3vk.onion
	mapaddress 192.0.2.4 pvuif6nonbhj3o3r.onion

And then put these IPs in your bitcoin.conf (or run bitcoin with -connect)

	connect=192.0.2.2
	connect=192.0.2.3
	connect=192.0.2.4

You can use any arbitrary IP addresses with MapAddress, though some of the common non-routable ranges (10.*, 192.168.*) will not work due to a Bitcoin bug (reference?). 192.0.2.1-192.0.2.255 is the recommended range because it is both non-routable and compatible with Bitcoin.

It is highly recommended that you use "connect" instead of "addnode" so that all of your communications are kept within the tor network.

<span style="color:red">Since Bitcoin 0.5, the client enables nolisten when the proxy setting is enabled, which in effect prevents the client from becoming a peer node. So the only way to operate a hidden bitcoin seed node would be to revert to an earlier version.
Update: This has been fixed in version 0.6.

## Adding a node

Before adding yourself as a fallback node, you should be sure your node will stay online for a long time. If a node is offline for more than 24 hours it will be removed from the list.

To add a node in this list, you just need the ip/hostname and your name, the other fields will be filled automatically. Insert the following lines before the <tt>END NODELIST</tt> line:

	<nowiki>|-
| ip || your name</nowiki>
