Please note, that all numbers of TBC and its divisions/multipliers are written in Tonal, not decimal.
This means that instead of counting 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10-- you count: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, , 9, , , , , , 10. Some higher-value digits may require installing a [font](http://luke.dashjr.org/education/tonal/glyphs/fonts/).

<small>* Tonal BitCoin and Decimal BitCoin can be differentiated by the pronunciation of the numbers. "One bitcoin", "two bitcoin", etc is decimal, but "an bitcoin", "de bitcoin" is tonal.</small>

The total number of Tonal BitCoins ever (analogous to the 21mil BTC) is just under 7.76 tam-TBC.

## Guessing TBC or BTC

Given variable 'value' in base units (uBTCents/TBCᵇ), one can guess whether it is properly Decimal BitCoin or Tonal BitCoin with the following pseudo-code:

	if ( ! ( this % 0x10000 ) )
	Choose Tonal BitCoin
	if ( ! ( this % 1000000 ) )
	Choose Decimal BitCoin
	if ( ! ( this % 0x100 ) )
	Choose Tonal BitCoin
