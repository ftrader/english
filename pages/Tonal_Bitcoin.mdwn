Please note, that all numbers of TBC and its divisions/multipliers are written in Tonal, not decimal.
This means that instead of counting 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10-- you count: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, , 9, , , , , , 10. Some higher-value digits may require installing a [font](http://luke.dashjr.org/education/tonal/glyphs/fonts/).

<small>* Tonal BitCoin and Decimal BitCoin can be differentiated by the pronunciation of the numbers. "One", "two", etc is decimal, but not tonal.</small>
