Formerly, an exchange that intended to put people in touch with buyers and sellers in their area.

##History


The site was announced on the bitcoin forums on April 26, 2011 (2.1).  It is listed on the [[GLBSE]] bitcoin share market and was the exchange's very first IPO.

It never launched, and was presumed to have either been a scam or a very poorly-executed plan.
