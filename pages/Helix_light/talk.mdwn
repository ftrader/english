Hello,

I just wanted to ask you why admins on this site are still posting scam links here?

grams7eo7mkagczs.onion   is fake HelixLight URL !!!!!!

grams7enufi7jmdl.onion/helix/light   is correct HelixLight URL !!!!!!

I messaged all bureaucrats here, but with no reply from them!

You're all scammers or what?

> An investigation is underway. When you insert links with no explanation, we just assume fraud. (Your [[recent choice of username|User_talk:Lukeisbitch]] doesn't seem to be a positive indicator either.) Thank you for explaining your actions, and as stated above, I will look into it.
