[BitcoinPaperWallet.com](https://bitcoinpaperwallet.com) is an open-source paper wallet generator based on the [[BitAddress]] generator. It runs on any modern web browser and relies on JavaScript for all cryptographic functionality.

## Differences from BitAddress

While BitAddress is capable of generating "brain wallets", pool-generated vanity wallets, and bulk wallets, BitcoinPaperWallet has been simplified such that its only function is to produce paper wallets. Additionally:

* Paper wallets printed using BitcoinPaperWallet feature a tri-fold design that is sealed shut so as to hide the wallet's private key and QR code from view.
* The reverse side of the design includes instructions for general use as well as a ledger for writing down deposits or other notes.
* The overall design includes a number of features to discourage casual tampering efforts that might otherwise reveal the private key without notice.
* The generator includes an option for printing a paper wallet by pasting in a self-generated private key or vanity address, bypassing the random address generator altogether

## Similarities to BitAddress

BitcoinPaperWallet is a GitHub "fork" of BidAddress and uses identical cryptography functions and methods. Similarly:

* The generator works entirely from within a web browser.
* Addresses are never transmitted over the Internet
* The full source code can be examined via "view source" in web browser.
* Cryptographic work is done using the the browser's built-in JavaScript crypto API along with open-source JavaScript libraries
* The generator can be run offline by [downloading a ZIP archive](https://github.com/cantonbecker/bitcoinpaperwallet) of the HTML from GitHub.
