**Skrill**, formerly MoneyBookers, is an e-commerce business allowing payments and money transfers to be made through the Internet. 

Moneybookers performs payment processing for websites, online auction sites, and other corporate users. Like many competing online fund transfer services (e.g., [[PayPal]]), Moneybookers requires identity verification before using their service to minimize fraud and prevent money laundering. 

Additional verification steps raise the maximum amount transferable to â‚¬50,000 or equivalent within a 90-day period. 

Moneybookers does not usually get involved in merchandise disputes and the availability of credit card chargebacks may be limited.
