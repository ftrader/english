BitcoinMedia is a community group blog dedicated to bitcoin content and distributing news. One of the first content sites dedicated to providing information and public relations about bitcoin.

First started as a one man operation bitcoinmedia is now run by a team of volunteers led by bitcoinconsultancy. Anyone wanting to announce news about bitcoin events or submit a press release can contribute to the site.
