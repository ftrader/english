This is for comments on djex's draft of a [Proposed Canadian Bitcoin Market Transaction Process Using Interac e-Transfer](http://j.mp/BTC-CAD-ex)

* *Bimmerhead suggested that if the buyer sends less than the total amount (say $15 out of $25), it might be a good option to let the seller cancel the whole transaction rather than automatically allow partial fulfillment.Just because the seller may have wanted an 'all or nothing' sale.* (May 17, 2011)*
> * Added in a possible solution for this. Check the document for latest change. -djex
