There is no official Bitcoin symbol as of December 2010, however the *BTC* abbreviation is the most universally accepted form.

## Unicode symbol

There is a discussion over [which Unicode symbol might be the best suited](http://www.bitcoin.org/smf/index.php?topic=369.0) for bitcoin.

To type Unicode characters, refer to:

* [[Microsoft_Windows_Unicode_Input]]
* [[How_to_easily_type_the_circled_B_symbol_on_a_Mac]]

It has led to the following options:
