There is no official bitcoin symbol as of December 2010, however the *BTC* abbreviation is the most universally accepted form.

## Unicode symbol

There is a discussion over [which unicode symbol might be the best suited](http://www.bitcoin.org/smf/index.php?topic=369.0) for bitcoin.

It has lead to the following options:

* ฿
	* Pro: Gives a currency-like look (it the symbol for an existing currency, the Thai Baht, but other currency symbols often get reused, like the $), Displayed correctly on all known OSes
	* Cons: It is already a currency, and might confuse people
* ☃
	* Cons: Wait, what?
* Ⓑ ⓑ
	* Cons: Do not display properly for everyone
* ᴃ
* ␢
* β
* ¤
* Ƅ
* ∄
* ℬ
* ઘ
	* Cons: No visible relation to bitcoin
* ϭ
