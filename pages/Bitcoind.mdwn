The **Original Bitcoin client** is the first [[bitcoin]] client in the network's history. It is also the official client of the bitcoin project. It's available under the [MIT license](http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php) for Windows, 32 and 64-bit GNU/Linux-based OSes and Mac OS X.

The client comes with two executables, a GUI and an command line interface (CLI).

## Executables
See [[running bitcoin|Running_Bitcoin]] for more detail and an example of the configuration file.
### Bitcoin (GUI)

The bitcoin GUI provides an easy to use wxWidgets-based interface. It allows to send coins and to monitor:

* transactions from and to the opened wallet
* block creations
* confirmations of transactions
* balance of the wallet

### Bitcoind (CLI)

Bitcoind is both a headless daemon and a client for the same daemon.  It also provides a JSON-RPC interface, allowing it to be controlled locally (via bitcoind or another CLI client) or remotely.  [[Various commands|Original_Bitcoin_client/API_Calls_list]] are made available by the API.

To use locally, first start the program in daemon mode:
> bitcoind -daemon

Then you can use the same program to execute [[API commands|Original_Bitcoin_client/API_Calls_list]], e.g.:
> bitcoind listreceivedbyaddress 0 true
> bitcoind getbalance
