The **Original Bitcoin client** is the first [[bitcoin]] client in the network's history. It is also the official client of the bitcoin project.

It comes in two executables.

## Executables

### Bitcoin (GUI)

The bitcoin GUI provides an easy to use interface, allowing to receive and send bitcoins, and generate bitcoins using the computer's CPU power.

### Bitcoind (CLI)

The bitcoind CLI interface runs as a daemon, and provides a JSON-RPC interface allowing to control it locally or remotely.
