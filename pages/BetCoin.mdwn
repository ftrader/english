### Creating a Bitcoin Education Portal

As bitcoin is a new currency and is not used in the same way as conventional currency, many people are still unaware it exists and those that have heard about it don't fully understand it or what can be done with it. BetCoin™ decided to create an education portal as part of the BetCoin™ Entertainment Network, so BetCoin™ Wiki was born. The mission: to provide an online portal containing everything thing there is to know about bitcoin, as well as to educate people on what this new currency is and how it can benefit them in everyday life. They strive to create a thriving community of like-minded people indulging in sharing information with others around the world.[[!img "Circle.png‎" size=120x120 title="BetCoin ™ Circle"]]
