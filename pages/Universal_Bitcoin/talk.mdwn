## why?
Sorry guys, maybe I don't get what you're trying to accomplish, but: Why would you want common fractions, like a sixth/eighth/ninth Bitcoin? Most currencies I know of use a hundredth, and I never heard anybody complaining there's not a San-Euro or Half-Euro denomination. 
*We should stay with SI units*: People all over the world use milli-meters, centi-meters, meters, and kilo-meters. It works, and even the dumbest apprentice at some point realizes that shifting zeroes is no black magic.

That would be mBTC, ÂµBTC, nBTC. 
"milli", "micro" and "nano" wont hurt anybody. The transition will be slow enough for everyone to get their meaning.

I dont want to live to see the day when Alice tries to find out if her *BitCoin-san*s and *Duni-BitCoin*s add up to get her something which is priced at one *Centi-Bitcoin*. --[Fusselwurm](User:Fusselwurm) 08:58, 13 June 2011 (GMT)
