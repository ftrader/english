##Trading

* Buying/selling

Market Orders: A buy or sell is executed at the best available price available for a certain quantity of bitcoin. <br/>
Limit Orders: A buy or sell order is executed, either partially of fully, when the order can matched against a counter order that meets a user defined price limit. 

###Maker Taker Trading Fees Schedule

Bitlish uses a maker-taker fee model. This means that fees are charged after trades are matched and a different fee is charged to the "maker" and to the "taker" of liquidity.

Maker fees are paid when you add liquidity to the order book, by placing a limit order below the lowest sell price for a buy and above the highest buy price for a sell. Taker fees are paid when you remove liquidity from the order book, by placing any order that is executed against a limit order already on the order book.

The fees are charged after an order is matched and not for placing an order. This fee model is used in order to incentivise the most liquidity so that any orders made get fulfilled quickly and at the best possible rate.

Trading fees are charged in corresponding fiat currencies and are subtracted from the total fiat amount reserved by the order in the total balance. (16.1)
