Accepts your payment, deducts a small commission and then forwards the balance on to a Bitcoin [[address]] that you designate. It is a laundering service of sorts.

Access to the site is available using only its Onion address through [[Tor]].

##History

From around March 12th until about March 17th, 2011, the site experienced a service disruption for several days before the operator noticed and subsequently made repairs (2.1).  Additional service issues were reported in April, 2011 (2.2).

Its mention on the forum first appeared on February 12th, 2011 (2.3).

On April 29th, 2011 entries for CoinTumblr were removed after service issues remained unresolved with no communications (2.4).
