##Design goals

Decentralized identity.

* Has some creation cost
* Sacrifice may be digitally proven, bootstrapping root of trust from blockchain data
* Start as anonymous; opt out of anonymity by attaching identifying key-value pairs (real.name = "John Smith").


##Creating sacrifice transactions

Similar to [Announce/Commit Sacrifices](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Fidelity_bonds#Announce.2FCommit_Sacrifices)

1. MPK = master public key
1. TM = current block height
1. create transaction T2.
	1. must include OP_RETURN ripemd160(MPK) output
	1. nlocktime = TM + 144 blocks
	1. no more than 1000 bytes in size
1. create transaction T1
	1. must include >= 0.001 BTC fee
	1. must include OP_RETURN serialized(T2) output
	1. no more than 1000 bytes in size
1. broadcast T1, T2 until confirmed


##Creating a SIN

A SIN is the unique record identifier by which this identity will be known.

1. Prefix = 0x18
1. SIN_Version = 0x01
1. MD = ripemd160(MPK)
1. SIN = base58_encode_check( Prefix + SIN_Version + MD )


##Validating the root identity information

1. B1 = block w/ T1, B2 = block w/ T2
1. Verify B2 height - 144 >= B1 height.  Fail and waste sacrifice if not.
1. Verify mined T2 == announced T2

Thus a minimal root record is MPK and is provably

* linked to the sacrifices
* MPK starts a new chain of digital signature trust, for further record updates

After that, additional key-value pairs may be associated with the root record via updates verified by PPK, stored in an alt-blockchain or DHT somewhere.  That is outside the scope of this minimal document.
