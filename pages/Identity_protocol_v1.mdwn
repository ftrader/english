##Design goals

Decentralized identity.

* Has some creation cost
* Sacrifice may be digitally proven, bootstrapping root of trust from blockchain data
* Start as anonymous; opt out of anonymity by attaching identifying key-value pairs (real.name = "John Smith").


##Creating sacrifice transactions

An implementation of [Announce/Commit Sacrifices](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Fidelity_bonds#Announce.2FCommit_Sacrifices).  That author's feedback on this protocol was very helpful.

1. MPK = master public key
1. TM = current block height
1. Create and sign transaction T2. Broadcast if desired.
	1. must include Hash160(MPK) OP_TRUE anyone-can-spend output with value >= 0.001BTC
	1. nlocktime = TM + 144 blocks
	1. no more than 1000 bytes in size
1. Create, sign and broadcast transaction T1
	1. must include OP_RETURN serialized(T2) output as last txout

##Creating a SIN

A SIN ("System Identification Number") is the unique record identifier by which this identity will be known.

1. Prefix = 0x18
1. SIN_Version = 0x01, similar to how [UUIDs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier)' form is dictated by a UUID's self-identified version
1. MD = Hash160(MPK)
1. SIN = base58_encode_check( Prefix + SIN_Version + MD )
1. Hyphenate or space SIN for easier human reading

##Validating the root identity information

1. B1 = block w/ T1, B2 = block w/ T2
1. Verify B2 height - 144 >= B1 height.
1. Verify announced T2 is valid
1. Verify mined T2 spends same inputs as announced T2 (not equal to account for [[Transaction_Malleability]])
1. Fail and waste sacrifice if not.


Thus a minimal root record is MPK and is provably

* linked to the sacrifices
* MPK starts a new chain of digital signature trust, for further record updates


##Future work

After that root identity is created, additional key-value pairs may be associated with the root record via updates verified by MPK, stored in an alt-blockchain or DHT somewhere.  That is outside the scope of this minimal document.
