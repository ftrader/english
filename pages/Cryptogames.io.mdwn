##Rules
	
**Minesweeper**

The Game is about a minefield passing. The Game Difficulty and Winning Probability is set by a field size. A minefield passing consists of several steps equitable to a quantity of the field columns. In each column could be only one mine. After every successful step, your win amount will be equal to the sum of Bet amount multiplied by Payout coefficient of the current step. The Player reserves the right to take the winning amount or to continue minefield sweeping. In case of undermining you lose all the winning amount.

**Dice**

You should guess the random number. Specify Bet Amount and a Win Chance and start the game by clicking Roll Low or Roll High. A random number will be generated from 00.00 to 99.99. If it is less than the Threshold (in the case when Roll Low is chosen) or more than Threshold (in the case when Roll High is chosen) then you win. The win amount is a sum of Bet Amount multiplied by a Payout coefficient.

**777 Slots**
After entering the bet amount to the corresponding field at the bottom of the machine, a user is ready to hit the spin and get an instant result. Auto-spin is also available in Cryptogames slots and allows playing the machine as many times as wanted while the balance is enough.

Every spin is random and independent of all past spins. It means that sequence of symbols in each reel is calculated every other time with no influence of previous or next reels. As soon as the winning combination is shown on the pay line, a user earns cryptocurrency. The payout is determined by the winning combination multiplied by the bet amount.

Winning combinations are sorted by the payout multiplier and are the following: 

* 7,7,7 — x 1000
* Diamond, Diamond, Diamond — x 500
* Coin, Coin, Coin — x 100
* 3Bar, 3Bar, 3Bar — x 50
