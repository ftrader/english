Cointeller's goal is to be the preferred method to pay and get paid globally in the Internet gaming industry. We have created an extensive network of licensed sportsbooks and casinos from around the world, and you can play at all of them with the convenience of the Bitcoin network.

Over the next fews months, the Cointeller Network will continue to grow as we add the best sportsbooks and casinos. Our goal is to have 50 members in the Cointeller Network by the end of 2014. You can view a list of currently offered Cointeller Network Sportsbooks by clicking the Cointeller Network button at the top of this page.

We aim to go above and beyond creating the largest network of reputable BTC sportsbooks and casinos. We will provide the best possible betting experience for our players through our staff of VIP Hosts, each of whom has received extensive training to provide a better customer experience. Our VIP Hosts work for Cointeller, not the sportsbooks, and are available to help you with anything you need.

Cointeller takes the security of our customers' deposits very seriously. We keep all customer deposit wallet addresses in cold storage, and you can always verify your deposit's safety via any blockchain website. To further secure player funds, we do not support any automatic withdrawals at this time. While this means it may take a few minutes for a VIP Host to complete your withdrawal request, it also means there is no way for our security to be compromised.

Just as there have been security issues in the Bitcoin world, the world of Sportsbooks also has its fair share of 'Gox' examples. By using Cointeller, you can sleep easy knowing that Cointeller guarantees your deposits and any winnings across all the Cointeller Network sites.
