The name chosen by popular vote in poll on the Bitcoin forum to represent the SI unit of 0.001 bitcoins (BTCs).

##Examples

* One thousand (1000) milliBits refers to 1 bitcoin or 1 BTC.
* Twenty seven milliBits refers to 0.027 bitcoins, or 0.027 BTC.
* 1.375 BTC may be referred to as one bitcoin and three hundred seventy-five (375) milliBits.

The poll was announced on May 14, 2011 to come to an agreement of a more commonly used name (2.1).  With the market exchange rate nearing $10 USD per BTC, a name for the sub-bitcoin unit was needed.

A milli is the International System of Units (SI) prefix representing one thousandth (1/1000th) (2.2).
