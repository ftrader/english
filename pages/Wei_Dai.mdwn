**Wei Dai** (戴维 in Pinyin). (1.1) is a computer engineer (1.2) and cypherpunk (1.3) best known as creator of [[b-money|#b-money]] and the developer of the Crypto++ library.  Dai is listed as inventor on U.S. patents 5724279 and 6081598 which were assigned to Microsoft.

## Education and career
Mr. Dai graduated from the University of Washington with a degree in computer science (2.1) and is described as an "intensely private computer engineer".  His profile as a member of the advisory board (2.2) for the (now defunct) VoteHere.net indicated:
<blockquote>
"Mr. Dai worked in the Cryptography Research Group at Microsoft Corporation in Redmond, Washington. While at Microsoft, he was involved in the study, design and implementation of cryptosystems for specialized applications. Prior to joining Microsoft, Mr. Dai was a programmer with TerraSciences of Acton, Massachusetts. Mr. Dai holds a Bachelor of Science degree from the University of Washington in computer science, with a minor in mathematics."
</blockquote>

## Cryptography
Dai has made numerous contributions to the field of cryptography and has identified critical Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) vulnerabilities affecting SSH2 (3.1) and the browser exploit against SSL/TLS known as BEAST (Browser Exploit Against SSL/TLS). (3.2) (3.3)

### Crypto++
Crypto++ (also known as **CryptoPP**, **libcrypto++**, and **libcryptopp**) is a free and open source C++ class library of cryptographic algorithms and schemes written by Wei Dai. Crypto++ has been widely used in academia, student projects, open source and non-commercial projects, as well as businesses.

### VMAC
[VMAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VMAC) is a block cipher-based message authentication code (MAC) algorithm using a universal hash proposed by Ted Krovetz and Wei Dai in April 2007. The algorithm was designed for high performance backed by a formal analysis. (5.1)

### b-money
In 1998, Dai helped to spark interest in [[cryptocurrencies|Cryptocurrency]] with the publication of "b-money, an anonymous, distributed electronic cash system".  In the paper, Dai outlines the basic properties of all modern day cryptocurrency systems: "...a scheme for a group of untraceable digital pseudonyms to pay each other with money and to enforce contracts amongst themselves without outside help". (6.1)

## Influence on the development of Bitcoin
Described as "money which is impossible to regulate", (7.1) Dai's **b-money** described the core concepts later implemented in [[Bitcoin]] (7.2) and other cryptocurrencies:

* Requires a specified amount of computational work (aka [[Proof_of_work]]).
* The work done is verified by the community who update a collective ledger book.
* The worker is awarded funds for their effort.
* Exchange of funds is accomplished by collective bookkeeping and authenticated with cryptographic hashes.
* Contracts are enforced through the broadcast and signing of transactions with digital signatures (i.e., [public key cryptography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography)).

### Relationship with Satoshi Nakamoto
Wei Dai and [[Adam_Back]] were the first two people contacted by [[Satoshi_Nakamoto]] as he was developing [[Bitcoin]] in 2008 and the b-money paper was referenced in the subsequent Bitcoin whitepaper. (8.1)

In a May 2011 article, noted cryptographer [[Nick_Szabo]] states:

[[!template id=quote text="Myself, Wei Dai, and [[Hal Finney (cypherpunk)" Hal Finney]] were the only people I know of who liked the idea (or in Dai's case his related idea) enough to pursue it to any significant extent until Nakamoto (assuming Nakamoto is not really Finney or Dai).<ref>{{cite news|author="Nick Szabo |url=http://unenumerated.blogspot.com/2011/05/bitcoin-what-took-ye-so-long.html | title=Bitcoin, what took ye so long?|date=2011-05-28 |accessdate=2014-03-12|work=Unenumerated}}</ref>"]]

However Dai questions b-money's influence on Bitcoin:

[[!template id=quote text="...my understanding is that the creator of Bitcoin, who goes by the name Satoshi Nakamoto, didn't even read my article before reinventing the idea himself. He learned about it afterward and credited me in his paper. So my connection with the project is quite limited.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lesswrong.com/lw/4cs/making_money_with_bitcoin/3lq1|title=Wei_Dai comments on Making money with Bitcoin?|author=Wei Dai|}}</ref>"]]

There has been much speculation as to the identity of Satoshi Nakamoto, with suspects including Wei Dai, [[Nick_Szabo]], [[Hal Finney|Hal_Finney_(cypherpunk)]] and accompanying denials. (8.2) (8.3) (8.4) (8.5)

### Wei currency unit
The smallest unit of [[Ether|Ethereum#Ether]] (cryptocurrency of the [[Ethereum]] network) is the **wei** (named after Wei Dai). (9.1) (9.2)
