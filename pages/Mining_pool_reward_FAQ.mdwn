## How does mining in a pool improve my payouts?
Pooled mining will not have a significant effect on the [expectation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expected_value) of your payouts (it can decrease a bit due to fees), but it can dramatically decrease their [variance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variance).

## What reward systems are there?
All reward systems use the concept of "share", a hash which is easier than the real difficulty and proves you have worked on finding a valid block. Your reward when the pool finds a valid block depends on the shares you submitted.

The main reward systems used are:
> **Pay per share**: Every share submitted receives a fixed BTC reward known in advance. This has virtually 0 variance and is thus good for beginners. The Pool Operator often takes a relatively large fee, due to the fact that they cannot know how much will be paid in total to all the miners.

> **Proportional** ("Share-based"): Every time a block is found, its reward is split between participants according to the number of shares they submitted. 

> **Score-based**: Each share submitted receives a score based on its age, and the block reward is split between participants according to their score. The variance of this method is slightly higher than proportional.

## What will be my expected payout per share?
Every share will give you, on average, the block reward (minus any pool fees) divided by the difficulty. For example, with a block reward of 50 BTC, 2% fee and difficulty of 240000, each share submitted will give on average 0.000204 BTC (204 Î¼BTC).

## How many hashes does it take to find a share?
On average, one share will be found for every 2^32, or 4.295 billion, hashes calculated. So at 1 MHash/s, you will find a share on average every 72 minutes.

## How much will the pool decrease my variance?
If you constitute a significant part of the pool (say, above 1%), your variance will be roughly proportional to your portion of the pool. If, for example, you are 20% of the pool, your variance will be 20% of solo mining variance (a decrease factor of 5 times).

If not, your variance will not depend on the size of yourself or the pool, but rather on the scoring method used. For proportional, the decrease factor is roughly difficulty/ln(difficulty). For the geometric method the decrease factor is roughly (1 + 2*difficulty*c), where c is the score fee parameter used.

Increasing the size of the pool will always decrease the variance, but at some point you will have diminishing marginal utility.
