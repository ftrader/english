Picostocks facilitates valuation and fundraising for high tech startup projects and companies and offers valuable services and benefits for both bitcoin investors and entrepreneurs. PicoStocks offers virtual investment into shares of stocks of startup companies and projects. The platform operates just like any stock exchange but the traded stocks remain legal property of PicoStocks and the platform user can remain anonymous.
##### PicoStocks is aimed to provide solutions for two problems 

* assessment of value of small startup companies and similar high risk assets
* access to seed financing for very early stage startup companies or projects
##### Several aspects of PicoStocks are innovative
PicoStocks benefits from the innovative character of the bitcoin network and enables instant global access to the platform. Currently the bitcoins in circulation are worth over 100M EUR. Every bitcoin owner can start using the platform within minutes. No type of private information or confirmation thereof is required. Potential users who donâ€™t own bitcoins can obtain them instantly on various exchange platforms if they have other virtual currencies.<br />
PicoStocks offers unprecedented transparency of its operations. All transactions, fees, rewards, dividend payments and bitcoin transfers between users and PicoStocks are public. Transparency will boost the trust in the functionality and safety of the platform.<br />
Facilitated by the bitcoin network PicoStocks offers unprecedented anonymity for the investors. All accounts on PicoStocks are linked only to a bitcoin account and are therefore anonymous. This offers anonymous peer review of projects and companies. Despite the anonymity of account holders evaluations are expected to reflect real market valuation because the evaluators have to use valuable bitcoins they own to place bids for offered assets.<br />
Because the initial valuation process is inexpensive, anonymous and relatively accurate it can be used by funding agencies to evaluate plausibility of grant proposals submitted by the listed companies and assess the effects of projects conducted or completed with public funding support.<br />
