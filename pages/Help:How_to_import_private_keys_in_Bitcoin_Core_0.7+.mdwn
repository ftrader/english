Then go to menu:
/Help/Debug Window

Now click on the tab - Console.

In the console at the very bottom is a text entry box in here enter:
importprivkey yourPrivateKeyInWalletImportFormat TheLabelThatIWant

Note that this can take a good few seconds and during that time it looks like the client has hung!

Once Imported you can check that you have the address by closing the Debug window and going back to your address book.
In there you should see the address you imported and the label.
