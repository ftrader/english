An exchange that matches buyers and sellers.

The service enables buyers and sellers to list orders.  It appears that the site functions as a publicly accessible order book information service.  The exchange references their escrow services however putting funds in escrow does not appear to be a prerequisite nor are there any links indicating how or where the escrow service may be used.  

This service is not to be confused with a similarly named service, [[BitcoinUSA]].
