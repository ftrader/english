#### WARNING btclevels.com scam

I write you as I was scamed by btclevels.com. I got still a bit above 8BTC in my account at them, but I am unable to get the bitcoins out there anymore. In the beginning all went fine when I started without an account. I send few bitcoins there, I got some back.

However as I noticed that sometimes they are loggin the oppusite price ( so if I bet the price goes up, beeing one the lower line of the marked, which did not changed anyway as there was not markedactivity during my bet, there system give me the higher value). If I bet the other way around the system give me (rendomly,- not allways) the higher value, even there is no marked activity.)

So then I had an idea to set a "blocker" with some of my bitcoins, to keep the marked very tight, so that there system cannot cheat me. ... I made my bets, waited and finally replaced my blocker to win actually my bet with btclevels.com. This system worked pritty well. Too well I think in btclevels eys.
The End of the storry is that I created myself an account on there page to get things faster and transfered about 3BTC, and tested my system further on. This was working very well. Then I transferted me my 3 bitcoins back which was working at this time and did some more btc. finally as I wrote above I still got about 8 BTC in my account.

Now when I try to transfer the btc to any adress I get the systemmessage "incorrect amount"  displayed. I already tried tro write them and got firstly even an answer:
"Hello dear user,
I've forwarded your claim to our financial dpt, 
please be standby, we'll write you some later.
Kind regards,
"

... after 2 Mails more from me as they did answered anymore I got this on 27. Aug:
"Dear MyName,
please be patient,
we will check everything and if there no problems with rules of playing - you will get your money.
I don't know about the reason of you cannot withdraw money, because other members of btclevels use it everyday. Our teamlead says that it may be fraud or something like that.
We will check today or in bad case tomorrow all logs of your play. I hope that everything is ok and I will send money to your btc address manually.
Thank you for understanding,
Adrian."

If I read correct they wanted to send me the money manually in a day or so,- right?

However since then they do not answer anymore at all to my Mails. I told them that if they do not get my btc to my adress I will complain this to the BTC community as I am doing here right now to warn you all about those scammers.

BTW: the provided Phonenumer they give is also wrong

YES they pay,- but just a very littel above the btc you are putting in. so If you winning to much they will not pay you anymore. SCAMMERS!!!!!


Because the scammers seems to be germans, as I am I think I will go to the police soon, anybody wants to join me please message me
