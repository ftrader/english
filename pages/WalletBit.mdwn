An [[eWallet]] service and a shopping cart interface / payment processing service.
<br />

The service allows users to deposit bitcoins directly into their online account, store bitcoins, and pay others from the balance held in the online eWallet.
<br />

This service has multiple language translations, making it one of the few multilingual online wallets. Bitcoins are able to be added through a randomly generated Bitcoin address and can be sent to other WalletBit users by email address or withdrawn to a suitable Bitcoin Address. A fee is incurred on deposit.

##History

The service was shared with a forum post on the Bitcoin.org forum on July 24, 2011 (2.1).

##Criticism

For about a week or ending March 7, 2012 the service had been responding with errors with no response from the site's operator (3.1).  Once the operator was contacted externally the problem was resolved quickly.
