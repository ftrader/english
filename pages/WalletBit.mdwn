An [[eWallet]] service and a shopping cart interface / payment processing service.
<br />

The service allows users to deposit bitcoins directly into their online account, store bitcoins, and pay others from the balance held in the online eWallet.
<br />

This service has multiple language translations, making it one of the few multilingual online wallets. Bitcoins are able to be added through a randomly generated Bitcoin address but can only be sent to other WalletBit users by email address or widthdrawn to a suitable Bitcoin Address. A fee is incurred on widthdrawals.

##History

The service was shared with a forum post on the Bitcoin.org forum on July 24, 2011 (2.1).

##Criticism

In late February 2012 through at least March 6, 2012 the service had been responding with errors with no response from the site's operator (3.1).
