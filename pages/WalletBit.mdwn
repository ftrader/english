**WalletBit will ultimately be replaced by [[BIPS]]**


An [[eWallet]] service and a shopping cart interface / payment processing service.

<br />

The service allows users to deposit bitcoins directly into their online account, store bitcoins, and pay others from the balance held in the online eWallet.
<br />

This service has multiple language translations, making it one of the few multilingual online wallets. Bitcoins are able to be added through a randomly generated Bitcoin address and can be sent to other WalletBit users by email address or withdrawn to a suitable Bitcoin Address. A fee is incurred on deposit.
