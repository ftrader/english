As the value of BC rose, I propose to reduce the amount.

0.01BTC is a day's salary in certain countries. And why are you waiting for 6 confirmations if this measure is really only a spam barrier?

## Require payment for new user creation

I believe that a payment is required on each new user creation, not just in order to gain edit powers.
Currently a new spam user is created every few minutes, and the [Recent Changes](Special:RecentChanges) page has become completely spammed.

>  Payment is only required to activate edit privileges, hence the flood of spam users.  but it's not a bad idea to have it be required for user creation too, to avoid that spam. The problem is that it'd require more development, and mtux doesn't really have time to do this for the wiki right now. 
>  In the meantime as a quick hack, you can just filter the recent changes list to exclude everything from the User namespace. [try this](https://en.bitcoin.it/w/index.php?namespace=2&invert=1&title=Special%3ARecentChanges). It's not perfect, since it also excludes user page edits... but it's good. :) [Nanotube](User:Nanotube) ([[talk|User_talk:Nanotube]]) 13:44, 30 April 2013 (GMT)
