An e-commerce business allowing payments and money transfers to be made through the Internet.

CurrencyFair can convert funds added from your bank account to a growing number of foreign currencies.  The covnerted funds can then be transferred to a beneficiary account that you specify.

The service is available for both individuals and businesses.

This ability to send directly to the recipient's bank will likely make CurrencyFair a preferred method that will allow those purchasing bitcoins through a person-to-person marketplace, such as the [[Bitcoin-otc]] marketplace, to transact internationally.

The service was launched in early 2009 (1.1).

##Fees
