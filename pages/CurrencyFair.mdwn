An e-commerce business allowing payments and money transfers to be made through the Internet.

CurrencyFair can convert funds added from your bank account to a growing number of foreign currencies.  The covnerted funds can then be transferred to a beneficiary account that you specify.

The service is available for both individuals and businesses.

This ability to send directly to the recipient's bank will likely make CurrencyFair a preferred method that will allow those purchasing bitcoins through a person-to-person marketplace, such as the [[Bitcoin-otc]] marketplace, to transact internationally.

The service was launched in early 2009 (1.1).  In 2010 a bitcoin community member contacted the service to request that the service add Bitcoin as one of the currencies supported though it does not appear that the organization has any plans to do so (1.2).

##Fees

Transfers out cost about $4 USD.
