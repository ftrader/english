##Fees
There are no fees when sending money.  The fee subtracted when money is received will vary based on the account type.

Payza holds balances that might be at risk.  The agreement states:
>  <tt>If you do hold a balance in your account, Payza will keep your funds separate from its corporate funds and will not use your funds for its operating expenses or any other corporate purposes</tt>. (12.1).
There is no mention if these funds are CDIC (Canadian) insured, FDIC (U.S.) insured, or any other indication of how or where these funds are held.
