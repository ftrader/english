>  <tt>If you do hold a balance in your account, Payza will keep your funds separate from its corporate funds and will not use your funds for its operating expenses or any other corporate purposes</tt>. (3.1).
There is no mention if these funds are CDIC (Canadian) insured, FDIC (U.S.) insured, or any other indication of how or where these funds are held.
