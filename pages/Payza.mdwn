An e-commerce business allowing payments and [[money transfers|tags/Money_transmitters]] to be made through the Internet.   Previously the brand the service was marketed as was AlertPay.

When sending money using Payza a purchase can be funded from an existing Payza balance or using a credit card.  When receiving money, all funds received are added to your Payza account balance.

Methods for depositing funds into an Payze account include bank wire, by linking a bank account (ACH) or by money order or certified check.  Methods from withdrawing funds from an Payza account include bank wire, an ACH transfer to a bank account, check or as funds added to your credit card.

##Fees
There are no fees when sending money.  The fee subtracted when money is received will vary based on the account type.

##Risks
Funds received through Payza can potentially be put at risk if the buyer requests a chargeback. Payza's policy is to close the account for any account holders who issue a chargeback.

Payza holds balances that might be at risk.  The agreement states:
>  <tt>If you do hold a balance in your account, Payza will keep your funds separate from its corporate funds and will not use your funds for its operating expenses or any other corporate purposes</tt>. (3.1).
There is no mention if these funds are CDIC (Canadian) insured, FDIC (U.S.) insured, or any other indication of how or where these funds are held.
