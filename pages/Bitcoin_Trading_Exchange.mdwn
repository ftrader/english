A market for trading bitcoins that runs on the i2p anonymous network.

The objective of the Bitcoin Exchange is to provide a convenient electronic exchange to facilitate the buying and selling of commodities in complete anonymity where no transaction is traceable back to anyone. No identifying information is ever requested from traders and no paper or electronic trails of any kind exist.

The exchange allows trading between bitcoins and the account-holder's USD balance.

The account holder's USD balance is then anonymous as well, as the only USD funds that will ever be added to or withdrawn from the exchange are transacted through the site's operator.

The operator of the site, maxkoda, registered on the Bitcoin forum just days prior to launching the site.  With any Bitcoin exchange, there are verying levels of risk that funds deposited in an account can be accessed at a later time.  Even more caution might be warranted regarding funds held by an exchange accessed solely through i2p.

##Adding Funds
