In financial accounting, an asset is an economic resource. Anything tangible or intangible that is capable of being owned or controlled to produce value and that is held to have positive economic value is considered an **asset**. Simply stated, assets represent value of ownership that can be converted into cash (although cash itself is also considered an asset).
