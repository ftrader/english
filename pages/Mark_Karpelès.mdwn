}}**Mark Marie Robert Karpelès**, (1.1) (1.2) also sometimes known by his online alias **MagicalTux**, was the CEO of [[Mt._Gox]]. (1.3) (1.4)

##Early life and education
Karpelès was born in Chenôve, France in 1985, the child of Anne Karpelès, a geologist. (2.1) He was raised in Dijon. (2.2) Between 1995 and 2000, Karpelès was educated at Collège Prieuré de Binson in Châtillon-sur-Marne and Prieuré De Binson in Dormans. (2.3) He then spent one year at Lycée Claude Bernard in Paris, before completing his education in 2003 at Lycée Louis Armand in Paris.

According to Jason Mick of Dailytech, Karpelès was found guilty of a financial computer crime and of money transfer fraud when he was somewhere between 13 and 18 years old. The court apparently gave him a 3 month suspended sentence and no criminal record. The legitimacy of these claims is disputed.

In 2009, Karpelès moved to Japan. (2.4) (2.5)

##Career
According to Karpelès' LinkedIn page, he worked from 2003 to 2005 at Linux Cyberjoueurs as a software developer and network administrator. (3.1) Karpelès is a PHP developer, and has contributed to the language's official repository of extensions with proctitle, (3.2) which allows the name of the current process to be changed on Linux systems.

Karpelès founded [[Tibanne_Co.]] in 2009. He is CEO. (3.3) (3.4) He was a founding member of the [[Bitcoin_Foundation]], created in 2012 with a mission to standardize and promote Bitcoin, and served on its board until February 2014. (3.5) (3.6) (3.7)

According to a joint report by Cyrus Farivar of Ars Technica and Pierre Alonso of Le Monde, Karpelès was found guilty of fraud when he was tried in absentia in France in 2010. He also admitted to having "pirated" a server to French authorities. He was sentenced to a year in jail but has not yet served his sentence. (3.8) (3.9)

[[Ross_Ulbricht]], while on trial for operating the undercover [[Silk_Road]] marketplace, claimed that the pseudonymous "Dread Pirate Roberts" behind Silk Road was not him but Mark Karpelès. (3.10) Karpelès publicly denied the claim on Twitter, (3.11) and Ulbricht was eventually found guilty. (3.12)

###Bitcoin Wiki
In 2010, Karpelès reopened the [[Bitcoin_Wiki]] with MediaWiki. Karpelès's MediaWiki and [[Martti_Malmi]]'s dokuwiki sites coexisted briefly before it was evident that the community preferred MediaWiki. (4.1) All pages on the dokuwiki instance were copied to the MediaWiki one by [[theymos]], and in 2015 the a project to import the complete history of those pages began. (4.2)

Karpelès also created [[CryptoPayment]], a MediaWiki extension that was used by the Bitcoin Wiki for several years. The extension granted editing rights to users who paid a small anti-spam fee.

Shortly after reopening the Bitcoin Wiki, Karpelès added a [[Bitcoin_Map]] tool to it. (4.3) The map plotted nodes geographically (4.3) and a still of it was featured on the [[index]] for years.

###Mt. Gox
Karpelès acquired 88% of the Tokyo-based company [[Mt._Gox]] from programmer [[Jed_McCaleb]] in 2011. (5.1) (5.2) (5.3) Mt. Gox filed for bankruptcy in Japan on February 28, 2014 and for [Chapter 15](wikipedia:Chapter 15, Title 11, United States Code) bankruptcy in the United States (Texas) in March 2014. (5.4) (5.5) (5.6)

Karpelès was subpoenaed by the [United States Department of the Treasury](wikipedia:United States Department of the Treasury)'s [Financial Crimes Enforcement Network](wikipedia:Financial Crimes Enforcement Network) to appear in Washington, D.C. to provide testimony on April 18, 2014. Karpelès, in a court filing by Mt. Gox lawyers, responded that he does not have a lawyer for this matter and therefore declined to appear. (5.7) (5.8) Karpelès instead sought to appear in D.C. to testify on May 5, 2014. (5.9) (5.10)[[!template id=clarification_needed]]
