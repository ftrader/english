##Currency exchanges
###Real-time Trading

In these systems, users place buys and sells themselves on the exchange and the price is set by the market. The exchange usually acts as a mutual platform between the two parties holding people's funds and performing the trade.

The exchange may take a small percent or charge a fee on withdrawals/deposits as their cost.
