##Currency exchanges
###Real-time Trading
In these systems, users place buys and sells themselves on the exchange and the price is set by a market. The exchange usually acts as a mutual platform between the two parties, holds the funds, executes the trade, then releases funds as requested.

The exchange may take a percent or charge a fee on trades/withdrawals/deposits.
