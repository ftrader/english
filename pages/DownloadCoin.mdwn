**DownloadCoin** enables you to upload any file under 100MB and specify a price that people must pay to access the file. The user is redirected to the download within seconds of payment being sent, and they can opt to have a link to the file sent via email as well.

No registration is required, just specify your Bitcoin address and price, then upload the file. You can also set the price in USD and it will dynamically alter the Bitcoin amount based on the exchange rate within the last few hours.

When your account balance reaches 0.01 BTC it's automatically withdrawn to the address specified.
