##Purported slander

My [edit](https://en.bitcoin.it/w/index.php?title=Eligius&oldid=33664) was reverted by Luke-Jr for supposedly containing "slander." I only added it because I found it noteworthy that the mining pool had been used, outside of its intended goal (mining bitcoins) to perform a DoS attack (or more specifically, [[a 51 % attack|Weaknesses#Denial_of_Service_.28DoS.29_attacks]]) in which the normal operation of the network is suspended by preventing transactions from being confirmed. Luke-Jr himself admitted to performing the DDoS attack in his Bitcointalk.org post, which I cited in the article. Besides, performing a DoS attack when the people performing the attack are completely uninformed that their hardware is used to attack an alt-chain is not ethical, let alone legal.

My reasoning for the edit is not slander, but to include notable events and incidents. We could clear the Bitcoin wiki out of all information and references to incidents and events that have happened over the years and have tarnished Bitcoin's reputation and popularity, but that wouldn't serve this site's nor the project's purpose at all. --[Matoking](User:Matoking) ([[talk|User_talk:Matoking]]) 13:45, 13 December 2012 (GMT)

* While I myself was responsible for the "attack" (which was not DDoS, at the very least), it was my personal actual and did not involve the miners of Eligius. --[Luke-jr](User:Luke-jr) ([[talk|User_talk:Luke-jr]]) 20:35, 14 December 2012 (GMT)
