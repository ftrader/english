New public and private keys are pre-generated and stored in a queue before use.

This pooling feature was added so backups of the [[wallet]] would have a certain number of keys that would be used in the future.  By default, the number of entries in the queue is 100 (1.1).

A command line option allows a greater or lesser number of keys to be maintained in the keypool (1.2).
