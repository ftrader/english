Was an online service that enabled leveraged speculation in its contract-for-difference (CFD) market against the Bitcoin to USD (BTC/USD) exchange rate.

##History

The service was launched on September 8, 2011 (2.1).  On March 1st, 2012 the site suffered a significant financial loss when a web hosting had an internal security breach that gave the attacker access to a wallet in which Bitcoinica stored funds.  More than 43K bitcoins were stolen by the attacker.  The operator provided a statement that reserves were sufficient to cover the loss (2.2). 

Announced on April 20, 2012 was that Bitcoinica had "reorganized" and was now operated as Bitcoinica LP and had become a registered Financial Services Provider (2.3).

On May 11, 2012 Bitcoinica suffered for the second time a security incident in which a large amount of coins were stolen from its hot wallet (2.4). 

On August 1, 2012 the Wendon Group investment fund as creditor to Bitcoinica LP announced that it will appoint a receiver under New Zealand law (2.5).
