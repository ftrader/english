An exchange that enables leveraged speculation in its contract-for-difference (CFD) market against the Bitcoin to USD (BTC/USD) exchange rate.

The service charges no trading fees but instead earns from the trading spread -- similar to how forex trading functions.
	
##Leverage

Caution is recommended for those not familiar with leverage and/or forex trading.

The default margin requirement level is 2.5:1 (2.1).  The level may raised to 5:1 (or higher) using the self-service settings function.

Leverage from funds added using bitcoins can purchase an even larger Bitcoin (long) position (2.2).  Similarly, funds added using USDs can be used to sell (short) bitcoins without already having bitcoins.

##History

The service was launched on September 8, 2011 (20.1).  On March 1st, 2012 the site suffered a significant financial loss when a web hosting had an internal security breach that gave the attacker access to a wallet in which Bitcoinica stored funds.  More than 43K bitcoins were stolen by the attacker.  The operator provided a statement that reserves were sufficient to cover the loss (20.2). 

Announced on April 20, 2012 was that Bitcoinica had "reorganized" and was now operated as Bitcoinica LP and had become a registered Financial Services Provider (20.3).
