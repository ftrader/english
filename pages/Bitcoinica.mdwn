An exchange that allows speculation on the Bitcoin to USD (BTC/USD) exchange rate using leverage.

The service was launched on September 8, 2011 (1.1).  At the time leverage offered was 5:1 though on November 19, 2011 the service dropped the default margin requirement level to 2.5:1[Bitcoinica changes default leverage to 2.5:1 for everyone](http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=52092.0).  The level may raised to 5:1 by placing a request via email. 

The service charges no trading fees but instead earns from the trading spread -- similar to how forex trading functions.
	
Caution is recommended for those not familiar with leverage and/or forex trading.

Funds may be added in the form of either MTGUSD or Bitcoins.  Leverage from funds added using bitcoins can purchase an even larger Bitcoin (long) position (1.2).  Similarly, funds added using USDs can be used to sell (short) bitcoins without already having bitcoins.
