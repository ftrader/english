1. The more confirms gathered, the more sure you become of the transfer's validity. After 6 confirms, you can be 100% sure everything was successful. It takes a while to process payments, so be patient. <br /> [[Six confirms bitcoin client.png]]<br /><br />

## Points to remember

* You don't need to be online for receiving BTC.
* You can create as many new addresses as you like. Using a different address each time makes you more anonymous.
* You are anonymous. Nobody can connect an address to your identity.
* You cannot send BTC to an invalid address. Typo's are not a worry as the payment will refuse to send.
