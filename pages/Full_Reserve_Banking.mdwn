A [[Full_Reserve_Banking]] or 100% reserve banking system is one in which banks must hold reserves for 100% of on-demand liabilities. This means that should on-demand creditors all simultaneously ask for repayment, the bank will be able to honor all its obligations. This contrasts with a system of [[Fractional_Reserve_Banking]].
