A [[Full_Reserve_Banking]] or 100% reserve banking system is one in which banks must hold reserves for 100% of on-demand liabilities. This means that should on-demand creditors all simultaneously ask for repayment, the bank will be able to honor all its obligations. This contrasts with a system of [[Fractional_Reserve_Banking]].


## Proof of Reserves

In the Bitcoin world, inasmuch as exchanges have acted like banks by holding user Bitcoin balances, we have seen instances of [[Fractional_Reserve_Banking]] practices and also bank-runs leading to insolvency. Most notably in the case of [[Mt._Gox]].
