**cgminer for Mac OS X** is the name of an unofficial binary distribution of [[CGMiner]] for Mac OS X computers.  It contains precompiled universal binaries (for Mac OS X 10.5+ on PPC/Intel) and includes the necessary libraries required to make them run, contained in a single package.  The website contains all compilable versions released by the official cgminer developers since version 3.3.1.

A launcher script is included to simplify entering command-line options, which then opens a Terminal window running cgminer.  Commands are remembered between subsequent launches.

###Requirements

* Mac OS X 10.5 PPC (USB mining only)
* Mac OS X 10.6+ PPC or Intel 32/64bit (USB or OpenCL-based mining)
