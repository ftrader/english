**TREZOR** is a [[hardware_wallet]] providing advanced security for handling bitcoin private keys.

Unlike traditional [[cold_storage]] methods (offline storage or paper wallet), TREZOR is able to make secure payments without exposing your private keys to a potentially compromised computer.  See [Security philosophy](https://doc.satoshilabs.com/trezor-user/securityphilosophy.html) for more info.


## How does it work?

TREZOR is basically a small computer. It is designed to protect your private keys from possible online and offline risks. In order to do this, TREZOR keeps the private keys away from the Internet and confirms the transactions in-device. That way you can always check the screen for the right address, amount and transaction fee before sending your bitcoins.

In layman's terms you can connect TREZOR to an infected computer and still be able to have 100% control over the funds in your device.

## Using TREZOR

TREZOR needs an online wallet or other client as a user interface. To ensure validity of communication between the device and the interface TREZOR uses pin scrambling matrix. See more here.

Make sure that the receiving address you have provided to someone else has not been changed by infected computer. Feature "Show on TREZOR" has been developed exactly for this purpose:

### Backup and recovery

Upon first activation you are asked to write down the seed phrase.

This means that in case your TREZOR is lost or stolen you can easily retrieve your coins to another TREZOR or any recovery seed compatible wallet.

* [Recovery procedure](http://doc.satoshilabs.com/trezor-user/recovery.html)

### Advanced Settings 

You can further improve the security (except the totally new way of entering PIN - see above) by using passphrase encrypted seeds and multiple passphrases to create so called "Hidden Wallets". More details here:
