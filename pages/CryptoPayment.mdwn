#About

**BitcoinPayment** is a MediaWiki extension to limit spam, by requiring a small one-time bitcoin payment before a user is allowed to edit or create pages.

While the payment is deliberately trivially small for a normal user, it presents a barrier to a mass-spammer. 

Funds sent to this wiki will be used to keep the wiki online (cost of domain name and hosting), and remaining funds will be donated to the [Bitcoin Foundation](https://www.bitcoinfoundation.org/). 

#Usage

In order to enable your user account to edit pages, log in and visit [[Special:BitcoinPayment]], and you'll be given an address to which to send a small amount of bitcoins.

Once you send the requested bitcoin amount to the address displayed and your payment is confirmed, your account will automatically be added to the [trusted group](https://en.bitcoin.it/w/index.php?title=Special:ListUsers&group=trusted) and be afforded edit privileges.

##Confirmations

Payments require the customary 6 blocks to confirm. However, if you send from MtGox, and don't choose the *open transaction* option, confirmation is instant (since the wiki receiving wallet is also MtGox).

#Uso (Español)

Si pagas tu acceso a la wiki en inglés (subdominio en.bitcoin.it/wiki) no podrás editar las páginas en Español. Para editar la wiki en Español (subdominio es.bitcoin.it/wiki/) el enlace a Especial:BitcoinPayment es este https://es.bitcoin.it/wiki/Especial:BitcoinPayment
