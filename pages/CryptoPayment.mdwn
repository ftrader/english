**CryptoPayment** is a MediaWiki extension to limit spam by requiring a small one-time bitcoin payment before a user is allowed to edit or create pages.  While the payment is deliberately small for a normal user, it presents a barrier to a mass-spammer.  Funds sent to this Wiki will be used offset moderate expenses (hosting, DDoS protection, security maintenance).  If any money is remaining it will go toward funding Bitcoin development.

##Usage

In order to enable your user account to edit pages, log in and visit [[Special:CryptoPayment]], and you'll be given an address to which to send a small amount of bitcoins. The current fee amount is 0.001 BTC, which is presently less than 1 USD.

Once you send the requested bitcoin amount to the address displayed and your payment is confirmed, your account will automatically be added to the [trusted group](https://en.bitcoin.it/w/index.php?title=Special:ListUsers&group=trusted) and be afforded edit privileges.

###Confirmations

Payments will be considered paid after it is confirmed in a Bitcoin block.

##Privacy

Note that this may allow adversaries to connect your bitcoin wallet to your wiki account via blockchain analysis. If this is a concern to you, take the appropriate steps to protect your [[Anonymity]].

## Code
Source will be released after the backend interface to bitcoind is rewritten.

## Disclaimer
This payment is merely an anti-spam measure as a one-time measure to enable an account for edit access.  The volunteer administrators of this site may revoke edit access for any or no reason, usually in response to abuse or spamming.  You are not entitled to any refund under any circumstance.
