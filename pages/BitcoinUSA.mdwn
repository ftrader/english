This exchange allowed the purchase and sales of Bitcoins for customers within the U.S. as well as internationally. 

Payment for purchases of bitcoins occurred through a bank account (ACH) or with either a money order or cash through the mail.  Bitcoin were sold to the exchange and proceeds would be deposited to the seller's bank account via (ACH).

The service required an official ID (State Driver's license or a National Passport) and a PIN number that was sent to the mailing address provided.

This service is not to be confused with a similarly named service, [[BitcoinUSD]].

##Fees

Each transaction had cost $1 plus a 2% conversion fee of the total amount of the transaction.  The minimum transaction amount was $10.  The exchange rate was locked-in at the time that the order was placed.

##History
The service was announced on March 8, 2011 (3.1).  As-of March 8th, 2011, only the registration function was operational on the site to allow those interested to begin the manual authorization steps prior to the site being ready.

The service was officially closed on April 9, 2011 citiing the lack of interest in an exchange that required U.S. KYC compliance (implemented by Bitcoin USA with a user agreement, a photo id requirement, and address verification) (3.2)
