An exchange allowing the purchase and sales of Bitcoins for customers within the U.S. as well as internationally.

Payment for purchases of bitcoins occurs through a bank account (ACH) or with either a money order or cash through the mail.  Bitcoin may be sold to the exchange and proceeds will be deposited to the seller's bank account (ACH).

The service requires an official ID (State Driver's license or a National Passport) and a PIN number is sent to the mailing address provided.

The service was announced on March 8th, 2011 (1.1).  As-of March 8th, 2011, only the registration function was operational on the site to allow those interested to begin the manual authorization steps prior to the site being ready.

This service is not to be confused with a similarly named service, [[BitcoinUSD]].

##Fees

Each transaction costs $1 plus a 2% conversion fee of the total amount of the transaction.  The minimum fee is $10.  The exchange rate is locked-in at the time that the order is placed.
