##History
> Main article: [[History_of_Bitcoin]]

The first mention of the concept of cryptocurrency is said to have been made in 1998 by Wei Dai on the cypherpunks mailing list.

Bitcoin can trace its origin to the [[B-money_Proposal]].  The paper [Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System](http://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf) describes the early concepts behind Bitcoin (2.1) and and precedes the first release of Bitcoin software.

The Bitcoin project was registered on November 9th, 2008. The Bitcoin network started up on January 3rd, 2009 with the [[genesis_block]]. The genesis block contains a media reference to the dealings of a central banker in the UK.

On February 9, 2011, and for a few days afterwards, Bitcoin sold for over $1 in most exchanges.

In the history of bitcoin, there have been a few [[incidents]], caused by problematic as well as malicious transactions. In the worst such incident, and the only one of its type, a person was able to pretend that he had a practically infinite supply of bitcoins, for almost 9 hours.
