The rules are very simple. The gamer should deposit Bitcoins to a personal account, make a bet and roll the dice. The system will generate a lucky number between 0 and 65535. If this number is lower than the specified target number, the gamer wins. The amount of the reward is calculated by the game multiplier times the betted amount.

### The Lucky Number

Each bet is verified using the day's secret and the last deposit's TXID. The lucky number is generated by an algorithm. A nonce, which is increased by 1 on every bet, is added to produce a string of numbers. The nonce is reset to 0 on every deposit. The lucky number is computed by the first 4 hex digits of hmac_sha512(secret, lastdeposittxid:nonce). The secret is released at the end of the day and it changes on a daily basis.
