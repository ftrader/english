## Bitcoin Open Source Release Process

Releases to the [[Bitcoin.org client|Original_Bitcoin_client]] project are built and released using this process:

* Labeled in github
* Binaries are created for the platforms affected (usually all, Windows, Mac and Linux).
* Binary file checksum(s) is(are) calculated and a message with those are signed by a core developer.
	* sha256 checksum
* Uploaded to sourceforge
* Blog post on Bitcoin.org
* Forum post on BitcoinTalk.org

##Verifying The Downloads

To verify the checksums, first ensure the checksum file is secure by decrypting the SHA256SUMS.asc file:
	$ gpg --decrypt SHA256SUMS.asc

Then verify the file checksum:
	$ openssl dgst -sha256 [release archive](binary)

Verify that the checksum matches the one in SHA256SUMS.asc
