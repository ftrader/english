## Reverting 'why compete' again
The 'why compete' section is anti-competitive. It assumes "there should be only one".

Alt chains are interesting economical and technical experiments. Some are scams, some are just meangingless ... but some might offer some technical or economical innovation [[Namecoin]] and possibly [[PPCoin]]. Hell, even [[Litecoin]] has some properties that could be more secure than Bitcoin - its 2.5 minutes between confirmations [might be inherently safer than Bitcoin](https://bitcoil.co.il/Doublespend.pdf).

Luke, please do not revert again without discussing.

If you don't like how it's worded, feel free to adjust it within reason, but merely deleting content like this is vandalism. --[Luke-jr](User:Luke-jr) ([[talk|User_talk:Luke-jr]]) 07:08, 31 December 2012 (GMT)

>  You can reply here instead of on bitcointalk, problem is that I don't get email notifications here (do you? not sure if there's a setting I'm missing), so it's much harder to keep track of conversation.
>  Please open a thread on bitcointalk to discuss, the wiki sucks at discussions.
>  The statement "There is no reason to create more by introducing competing crypto-currencies." is a personal opinion of yours. Why do you recon it belongs in the article? A lot of people do believe there is ample reason to create competing crypto-currencies ... the reasons for their creation are varied.

>  "To date, the only established legitimate reason to start an alt chain, is if you wish to use it for a new purpose - that is, not as a currency."
>  So you claim all the creators of all alts except Namecoin "didn't have a legitimate reason to do it"? What constitues as "legitimate reason"?
>  This part is meaningless (there is no authority to determine what "legitimate" means, and no proof that many alts were not started for legitimate reasons).
> 
>  So, to sum up - you are taking your view of what's legitimate and embedding it into the article. Do you have any supporting evidence for your opinions about alts, or people backing up these opinions?
