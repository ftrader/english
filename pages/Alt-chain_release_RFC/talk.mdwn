## Reverting 'why compete' again
The 'why compete' section is anti-competitive. It assumes "there should be only one".

Alt chains are interesting economical and technical experiments. Some are scams, some are just meangingless ... but some might offer some technical or economical innovation [[Namecoin]] and possibly [[PPCoin]]. Hell, even [[Litecoin]] has some properties that could be more secure than Bitcoin - its 2.5 minutes between confirmations [might be inherently safer than Bitcoin](https://bitcoil.co.il/Doublespend.pdf).

Luke, please do not revert again without discussing.

If you don't like how it's worded, feel free to adjust it within reason, but merely deleting content like this is vandalism. --[Luke-jr](User:Luke-jr) ([[talk|User_talk:Luke-jr]]) 07:08, 31 December 2012 (GMT)
