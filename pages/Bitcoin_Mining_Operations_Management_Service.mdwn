Vladimir formerly offered a **Bitcoin Mining Operations Management Service** â€” you buy and install the [[mining_rig]] hardware and this service will take care of everything else, remotely, for a cut of the bitcoin proceeds.

The hosting service has been discontinued however the operator still sells contracts where a specified service laevel (measured in terms of GHash/second) is purchased for a specified length of time.
