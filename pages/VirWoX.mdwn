##Instructions

###How to buy bitcoins

Technically, VirWoX only supports the exchange BTC for Linden Dollars. However, you can first buy Linden Dollars for real-world currency, and then buy BTC for your Linden Dollars. It is not necessary to open a Second Life account to do this.

After you have opened (3.1) an account, deposit money into your VirWoX account (on the "Deposit" page) using one of the payment methods in the table below:



|[[!template id=rh]]Bank Wire|[[!template id=yes]]|[[!template id=yes]]|[[!template id=yes]]|[[!template id=yes]]|unlimited|free (if from EU in EUR)
|[[!template id=rh]][[PayPal]]|[[!template id=yes]]|[[!template id=yes]]|[[!template id=yes]]|[[!template id=yes]]|variable (see "Limits")|EUR 0.35 + 3.4%
|[[!template id=rh]]Credit/Debit Cards ([[Moneybookers]])|[[!template id=yes]]|[[!template id=yes]]|[[!template id=yes]]|[[!template id=no]]|variable (see "Limits")|EUR 0.39 + 3.5%
|[[!template id=rh]]SOFORTbanking / Sofort√ºberweisung|[[!template id=no]]|[[!template id=yes]]|[[!template id=no]]|[[!template id=no]]|variable (see "Limits")|2.5% (min. EUR 0.25)
|[[!template id=rh]][[UKash]]|[[!template id=yes]]|[[!template id=yes]]|[[!template id=yes]]|[[!template id=no]]|500 EUR/day|15%
|[[!template id=rh]]paysafecard|[[!template id=yes]]|[[!template id=yes]]|[[!template id=yes]]|[[!template id=yes]]|200 EUR/day|20%


Then you need to enter an order to sell your money (e.g. USD) for SLL (=Linden Dollars), e.g. on the "Exchange USD/SLL" page. Next, buy BTC on the "Exchange BTC/SLL" page. Depending on the type of order (Market or Limit), this will convert the Linden Dollars to BTC immediately or at some later time (3.2).

Finally use the "Withdraw" page to send the BTC to a Bitcoin address. You can also use VirWoX as a [[eWallet]] and keep your BTC there for later use.

###How to sell bitcoins

After your have opened (4.1) an account, go to the "Deposit" page, scroll down to the "Bitcoin" section and click on the "Create my Bitcoin address" button.
This will create a unique bitcoin address associated with your account. You then send the bitcoins you wish to sell to this address.
As soon as the bitcoin network has [[confirmed|confirmation]] the payment (5 blocks), the bitcoins are booked to your account, and an email is sent to you.

####For Linden Dollars

To exchange bitcoins to Linden Dollars, go to the page "Exchange BTC/SLL", and enter an order to sell your bitcoins.
Depending on your order (Market or Limit), this will be executed instantly or at some later time.
You may then withdraw the Linden Dollars to your Second Life avatar or continue as described below.

(e.g. USD/SLL for USD, EUR/SLL for EUR), and buy the real-world currency for the Linden Dollars. Then proceed to the "withdraw" page
and send the money using one of the supported withdrawal methods:



|[[!template id=rh]]Bank Wire|[[!template id=yes]]|[[!template id=yes]]|[[!template id=yes]]|[[!template id=yes]]|2-3 days|unlimited|1 EUR (if from EU in EUR)
|[[!template id=rh]][[PayPal]]|[[!template id=yes]]|[[!template id=yes]]|[[!template id=yes]]|[[!template id=yes]]|instant|2500 EUR/day|1 EUR/USD/GBP/CHF
