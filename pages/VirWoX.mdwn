##Instructions

###How to buy bitcoins

####With Linden Dollars
After you have opened (4.1) an account,
deposit the Linden Dollars (SLL) at one of the in-world terminals (4.2) in Second Life.

Then log in on the VirWoX website and enter an order to buy BTC on the "Exchange BTC/SLL" page. Depending on the type of order (Market or Limit),
this will convert the Linden Dollars to BTC immediately or at some later time (4.3).
Finally use the "Withdraw" page to send the BTC to a Bitcoin address. You can also use VirWoX as a [[eWallet]] and keep your BTC there for later use.

####With other currencies (USD, EUR, etc.)
Technically, VirWoX only supports to buy BTC for Linden Dollars. However, you can first buy Linden Dollars for real-world currency, and then buy BTC for your Linden Dollars as described above.
