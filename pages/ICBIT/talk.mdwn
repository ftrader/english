Please stop deleting material this page.  For a very long time ICBIT's webpage clearly explained that it was not a central counterparty.  Now it's been changed to something absurdly self-contradictory that essentially says "we call ourselves a central counterparty but we aren't one".  The whole point of having a futures exchange is that you're exposed to credit risk from only one party and you know who that party is (the exchange).  ICBIT is not doing that.  If they decide to do that and say so publicly, then feel free to change this page, but unless/until then please stop deleting important facts.
