There are various methods for selling bitcoins.

<span style="color:red">Warning: Please be careful with your money.  When sending bitcoins to an exchange or other counterparty you are trusting that the counterparty will not abscond with your bitcoins and that the operator maintains secure systems that protect against theft -- internal or external.  It is recommended that you obtain the real-world identity of the counterparty and ensure that sufficient recourse is available.  Exchanging or storing significant funds with exchanges is not recommended.</span>
