##Large amounts
For large amounts of bitcoin (USD 1000 or more), you probably would get the best rate if you withdraw funds via ACH or via [[Liberty_Reserve]] into a major exchange. The following exchanges are currently available that offer withdrawals into the banking system.

* [[MtGox]]
* [[Bitcoin_Central]]
* [[BitcoinUSA]]
* Other [[Exchanges|tags/Exchanges]]

##Small amounts

For smaller amounts conversion fees are usually too expensive. Thus other methods are usually a better choice. The following exchanges will enable you to redeem smaller amounts of bitcoins at reasonable rates:

* [[CoinCard]] sell bitcoins and receive payment through [[PayPal]] or purchase virtual prepaid cards with bitcoins
* [[bitcoin.local]] arranges for exchanging currencies in person with someone nearby.
* [[Bitcoin_2_Credit_Card]] purchase virtual VISA prepaid cards with bitcoins
* [[Bitcoin_Morpheus]] purchase reloadable debit cards with bitcoins
