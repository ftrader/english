There are various methods for selling bitcoins.

<span style="color:red">Warning: Please be careful with your money.  When sending bitcoins to an exchange or other counterparty you are trusting that the counterparty will not abscond with your bitcoins and that the operator maintains secure systems that protect against theft -- internal or external.  It is recommended that you obtain the real-world identity of the counterparty and ensure that sufficient recourse is available.  Exchanging or storing significant funds with exchanges is not recommended.</span>

##Market Exchanges
Market exchanges are those in which buy orders are matched with sell orders, so the price offered depends on the market. If a service quotes a price then it is not operating a market but instead is a broker that buys and/or sells coins. Those exchanges are found in the list of fixed-rate exchanges.
