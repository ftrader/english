The **economic calculation problem** is a criticism of using [[economic_planning]] as a substitute for [[market-based|Market_(economics)]] allocation of the [[factors_of_production]]. It was first proposed by [[Ludwig_von_Mises]] in his 1920 article "[[Economic_Calculation_in_the_Socialist_Commonwealth]]" and later expanded upon by [[Friedrich_Hayek]]. F. A. Hayek, (1935), "The Nature and History of the Problem" and "The Present State of the Debate," in F. A. Hayek, ed. *Collectivist Economic Planning*, pp. 1–40, 201–43. 

In his first article, Mises describes the nature of the price system under capitalism and describes how individual [[subjective values|subjective_value_theory]] are translated into the objective information necessary for [[rational|Rational_choice_theory]] allocation of resources in society.[[!template id=citation_needed date="May 2013"]]

In market exchanges, prices reflect the [[supply_and_demand]] of resources, labor and products. In his first article, Mises focused his criticism on the inevitable deficiencies of the [[socialisation|Socialization_(economics)]] of capital goods, but Mises later went on to elaborate on various different forms of socialism in his book, *[[Socialism|Socialism_(book)]]*. Mises and Hayek argued that economic calculation is only possible by information provided through market prices, and that bureaucratic or technocratic methods of allocation lack methods to rationally allocate resources. The debate raged in the 1920s and 1930s, and that specific period of the debate has come to be known by [[economic historians|Economic_history]] as *The [[Socialist_Calculation_Debate]]*. Mises' initial criticism received multiple reactions and led to the conception of trial-and-error [[market_socialism]], most notably the [[Lange–Lerner_theorem]].
