The **economic calculation problem** is a criticism of using [[economic_planning]] as a substitute for [[market-based|Market_(economics)]] allocation of the [[factors_of_production]]. It was first proposed by [[Ludwig_von_Mises]] in his 1920 article "[[Economic_Calculation_in_the_Socialist_Commonwealth]]" and later expanded upon by [[Friedrich_Hayek]]. (1.1) (1.2) In his first article, Mises describes the nature of the price system under capitalism and describes how individual [[subjective values|subjective_value_theory]] are translated into the objective information necessary for [[rational|Rational_choice_theory]] allocation of resources in society.[[!template id=citation_needed date="May 2013"]]
