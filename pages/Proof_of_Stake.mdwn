Proof of Stake is a propose alternative mechanism to [[Proof_of_Work]] as a way to mine Bitcoin and sign transactions.
It was probablly first proposed [here](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=27787.0) by Quantum Mechanic. With Proof of Work, the probability of mining a block depends on the work done by the miner (e.g. CPU/GPU cycles spent checking hashes). With Proof of Stake, the resource that's compared is the amount of Bitcoin a miner holds - someone holding 1% of the Bitcoin can mine 1% of the "Proof of Stake blocks".

Some argue that methods based on Proof of Work alone might lead to a low network security due to [[Tragedy_of_the_Commons]], and Proof of Stake is one way of changing the miner's incentives in favor of higher network security.

Here is [one attempt](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=37194.msg462786#msg462786) to describe an implementation of Proof of Stake.
