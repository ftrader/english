**Bitcoin Savings & Trust** (abbreviated as **BST**) was a ponzi scheme operated by [[Trendon_Shavers]] (then known as **Pirate**). It was launched in November 2011 as **First Pirate Savings & Trust**. Pirate claimed to have been selling bitcoins to some local tight-lipped buyers, (1.1) and that he started BST to provide more volume to these buyers. (1.2) By selling invested bitcoins at a high rate and [rebuying them at the market price](Wikipedia:Arbitrage), Pirate was supposedly able to offer a very high-yield interest rate of 7% per week. (1.1) (1.2) This rate attracted many investors, (1.2) and Pirate claimed that over 500,000 bitcoins had been deposited. (1.2) (1.3)

After accumulating an ever larger amount of bitcoin, transactions were becoming difficult and expensive. (1.4) Pirate attempted to reduce the strain by lowering the interest rate, but this sparked unrest and mass withdrawals. (1.4) After a discussion with his clients, Pirate decided to close BST, (1.4) and announced his intentions to return all owed bitcoins. (1.3) (1.4) After repaying at least 11 small beneficiaries, (1.3) BST suddenly announced default on August 28, 2012. (1.5) It was later revealed that the missing money went towards "rent, car-related expenses, utilities, retail purchases, casinos, and meals." (1.6)
