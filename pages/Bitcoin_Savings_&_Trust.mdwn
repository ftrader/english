**Bitcoin Savings & Trust** (abbreviated as **BST**) was a ponzi scheme operated by [[Trendon_Shavers]] (then known as **Pirate**). It was launched in November 2011 as **First Pirate Savings & Trust**. Pirate claimed to have been selling bitcoins to some local tight-lipped buyers, (1.1) and that he started BST to provide more volume to these buyers. (1.2) By selling invested bitcoins at a high rate and [rebuying them at the market price](Wikipedia:Arbitrage), Pirate was supposedly able to offer a very high-yield interest rate of 7% per week. (1.1) (1.2)
