This is meant as a simple message to send to merchants to introduce the concept of bitcoins to them and provide information on how to get setup. If you see any ways to improve this message, feel free to edit it. 

This was originally written to convince a person who sells alternative medicine, and I left that text in as an example. It should be modified to suit your target audience.

You might want to consider Bitcoin as a payment option for your website. It is a decentralized digital currency. 

The video here helps explain how it works:

If you chose to accept bitcoins on your site, you can use this as a payment processor:
https://bitpay.com/
and they automatically convert bitcoins into USD and deposit in your bank account. There are other payment processors on this page:

The benefit to your business is that there are a lot of people with bitcoins that like to support businesses that use bitcoins. This means basically tapping into a niche market of people that are into a fringe alternate currency that might also be open to alternative medical products. [NOTE: modify the message here to relate to whatever the business is]

If you do start accepting them, let me know, and provide me a little press release. I will make sure it ends up on the bitcoin forums. 

If you have any questions, feel free to ask. And in case you are wondering, I am not tied to any of the businesses or services listed above. I am just an advocate of bitcoin, and I like to see businesses accepting them.
