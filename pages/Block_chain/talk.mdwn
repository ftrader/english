*"More serious forks have occurred after fixing bugs that required backward-incompatible changes."* Any more infos on this? What kind of forks respective bugs were this?

Describing the main orphan chains and their reason would also be useful. --[Http](User:Http) ([[talk|User_talk:Http]]) 15:33, 1 April 2013 (GMT)


It would be nice if we could start off with an explanation for a layman instead of getting super technical right away. -osmosis

## Rename from "Block chain" to single word "Blockchain"?

It seems that much of the writing nowadays uses a single word "Blockchain" instead of two words.  We currently redirect [[Blockchain]] to [[Block_chain]].  I would like to propose that we reverse this so that the main article is named Blockchain and [[Block_chain]] redirects to that.  

* The [Oxford English Dictionary](http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/blockchain) and [Wiktionary](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/blockchain) defines the term as "blockchain" with no space.
* I think *Blockchain* is now used by the vast majority of sources: Google News currently reports 6,200 results for *[block chain](https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&gl=us&tbm=nws&authuser=0&q=%22blockchain%22&oq=%22blockchain%22&gs_l=news-cc.3..43j0l10j43i53.7098.36877.0.41674.18.15.3.0.0.0.287.1424.10j4j1.15.0...0.0...1ac.1.OIswtZZE-qs#hl=en&gl=us&authuser=0&pws=0&tbm=nws&q=%22block+chain%22+-%22blockchain.info%22)" and 224,000 for *[blockchain](https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&gl=us&tbm=nws&authuser=0&q=%22blockchain%22&oq=%22blockchain%22&gs_l=news-cc.3..43j0l10j43i53.7098.36877.0.41674.18.15.3.0.0.0.287.1424.10j4j1.15.0...0.0...1ac.1.OIswtZZE-qs#hl=en&gl=us&authuser=0&pws=0&tbm=nws&q=%22blockchain%22+-%22blockchain.info%22)". Note: "blockchain.info" was excluded from Google search results to prevent false matches.

Thoughts?

>  Satoshi always said "block chain", never "blockchain". I prefer it as two words for this reason and because it clearly disambiguates between the Bitcoin network structure and blockchain.info. [theymos](User:Theymos) ([[talk|User_talk:Theymos]]) 00:40, 10 February 2016 (UTC)
