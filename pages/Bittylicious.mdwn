*Bittylicious* is a site selling Bitcoins primarily for UK bank transfers and UK and Europe credit cards. New methods and countries are being added gradually. Bittylicious also offers users the ability to sell Bitcoins to Bittylicious brokers.

* Registered (i.e. email address verified)
* Mobile phone number verified
* ID documents verified
* Bank account verified via miiCard
* Existing user for a long time

##History

Bittylicious launched for beta testing on June 20, 2013 (2.1) and fully on June 24, 2013.

Since then, various tweaks have been made and Bittylicious is now multi-currency, multi-country and multi-altcoin capable.
