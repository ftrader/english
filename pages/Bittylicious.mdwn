*Bittylicious* is a site selling Bitcoins primarily for UK bank transfers. New methods and countries are being added gradually.

* Registered (i.e. email address verified)
* Mobile phone number verified
* ID documents verified
* Bank account verified via miiCard
* Existing user for a long time

##History

Bittylicious launched for beta testing on on June 20, 2013 (2.1) and fully on June 24, 2013.

Since then, various tweaks have been made and Bittylicious is now multi-currency and multi-country capable.
