  Title: Fixed Length "version" Message (Relay-Transactions Field)

##Abstract

[[BIP_0037]] introduced a new flag to version messages which says whether to relay new transaction messages to that node.

The protocol version was upgraded to 70001, and the (now accepted) BIP 0037 became implemented.

The implementation is problematic because the RelayTransactions flag is an optional part of the version message stream.
