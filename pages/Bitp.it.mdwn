Bitp.it is an embedable Javascript Bitcoin Miner which creates a  [[Distributed Miner|Distributed_Miners]] through sending workunits to different browsers viewing a webpage.

##Overview

To use Bitp.it, the user signs up on the homepage. They then are sent a customized javascript script to embed in the <head> section of their webpage. This then uses the browser of users viewing the webpage as a [[Cpu_Miner]], pooling the distributed resources to earn Bitcoins through [[Slush's Pool|Bitcoin_Pooled_Mining]].

##History

The project was announced on the [Bitcoin Forum](http://forum.bitcoin.org/index.php?topic=9042.msg130817#msg130817) on May 20, 2011 by 1bitc0inplz, one of the lead developers.

The project, met with resounding approval, soon gained a better UI and more features such as an overview of the performance of all sites, the ability to change your wallet, and a view of the current balance.
