An implementation of BitCoin for iOS devices (iPhone, iPad, iPodTouch).  

The App acts as a client and communicates using the regular RPC-JSON with bitcoind which runs on a separate thread inside an App.  The wallet is thus stored on the device.

##History

The project was announced on April 8th, 2011 (2.1).
