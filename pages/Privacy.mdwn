**Privacy** is the ability of an individual or group to seclude themselves or information about themselves and thereby express themselves selectively. The boundaries and content of what is considered private differ among cultures and individuals, but share common themes. When something is private to a person, it usually means there is something to them inherently special or sensitive. The domain of privacy partially overlaps [[security]], including for instance the concepts of appropriate use, as well as protection of information. Privacy may also take the form of bodily integrity.
