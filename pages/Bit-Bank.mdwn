An [[eWallet]] service. 

The service allows users to deposit bitcoins directly into their online account, as well as generate addresses to give out to others. 

The site also gives every user a unique URL (accessible at http://bit-bank.org/user/name where *name* is the username), which allows the user to give this URL out to others online, granting them the ability to deposit bitcoins into their account.
