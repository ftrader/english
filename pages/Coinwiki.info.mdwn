**Coinwiki.info** is a wiki about Bitcoin, altcoins and related stuff.

##History
Coinwiki was started by [Guaka](User:Guaka) ([[talk|User_talk:Guaka]]) on December 16th, 2013, inspired by doing some work on the [[Mastercoin]] wiki and the lack of wiki community development on the main Bitcoin wiki.
