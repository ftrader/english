**Bidding Pond** is Bitcoin's first site dedicated to offering best bid and fixed price auctions for the Bitcoin economy.

##Listings
Payment methods for an auction listing on BiddingPond may include non-bitcoin methods as well, such as [[PayPal]] and cash.

##Fees
A seller can list an auction at no charge.  BiddingPond does have optional services, such as the Buy Now and Highlighted Listing features which do incur fees.

New accounts reportedly receive a credit balance, enough so that an auction or two using the optional services can be made at no cost.

##Restrictions
There are few restrictions compared to other online auction services such as eBay.
