##History view while not logged in

Reported via IRC:

	<topynate> i'm getting unusual behaviour trying to view the history for Script at https://en.bitcoin.it/w/index.php?title=Script&action=history while logged-out-
	<topynate> it redirects me to a page-not-found in spanish
	<topynate> well, not exactly. i see a standard "no history" page in spanish
	<nanotube> topynate: i can confirm, seeing the same behavior.
