To file a new issue, add a second-level heading (==), and describe your issue in detail.

Issue discussion should happen on the Talk page.

## Presented with SSL cert from another site

A few times on 2014-03-27, non-deterministically across a few pages, I got the typical "wrong SSL cert" warning from Firefox, saying I'd been delivered the cert for **kitchensurfing.com**, issued the same day.

## Backup site broken

dump.bitcoin.it just goes to the Main Page

## Bitc<b></b>oin:* namespace interwiki links broken

Links to <b></b>[[coin:Community portal]] (for example) get turned into broken bitcoin: URI links.

## Make the anti-spam payment system more discoverable
I understand that [[Cryptopay]] is [replaced](being)(http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/27lofu/dear_bitcoin_foundation_please_take_ownership_of/ci20i6t). Can you give us more details on that? The new system should be more discoverable by new users - I suggest a notification for every new user on how to edit. (people still ask me how to edit the damn thing).

## Require a fee for new user registration
There is still a big spam problem in the [Recent Changes page](https://en.bitcoin.it/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&limit=500).

## Use a proper issue tracker
I know you like wikis ... but can't we use something like Zendesk to track issue?
Wikis weren't designed to be issue trackers...
