## What if I'm 1% towards calculating a block and...?

"There's no such thing as being 1% towards solving a block. You don't make progress towards solving it."

Is this true?  I don't know if there's a nonce which will solve any given block, but for a block that is solvable, it's possible to be 1% of the way towards finding it.  Supposing it takes 10 million attempts to 'solve' a block, then after 100,000 attempts you could say you were 1% towards solving it.  You're certainly closer to solving it than you were before those 100,000 failed attempts, aren't you? [Dooglus](User:Dooglus) 05:05, 15 January 2011 (GMT)
