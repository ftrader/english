Formerly a [[currency_exchange]] site that served those trading between bitcoins and multiple currencies.

##History

The service was announced April 5th, 2011 (2.1).  On March 26, 2012 the order system was changed so that buy orders had to execute immediately (2.2).

After increasingly degraded service, on December 21, 2012 the operator shared that the customer's funds had been used for speculation and that nearly 20,000 BTC of its customer's funds were lost (2.3).
