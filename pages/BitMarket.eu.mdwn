A [[currency_exchange]] site serving those trading between bitcoins and the following currencies:
	
* EUR (Euro)
* PLN (Polish ZÅ‚oty)
* GBP (British Pound Sterling)
* USD (United States Dollar)
* CAD (Canadian Dollar)
* AUD (Australian Dollar)
* RUB (Russian Ruble)
* CHF (Swiss Franc)
* ZAR (South African Rand)
* ILS (Israeli Shekel)

BitMarket.eu handles the bitcoins involved in the transaction, while fiat currency transfer is handled directly between the transaction partners.

The order book contains only sell orders and buy orders are not accepted unless there is a corresponding sell order at that price.  Payment (e.g., wire transfer) is then coordinated between buyer and seller.

##History

The service was announced April 5th, 2011 (2.1).  On March 26, 2012 the order system was changed so that buy orders had to execute immediately (2.2).

After increasingly degraded service, on December 21, 2012 the operator shared that the customer's funds had been used for speculation and that nearly 20,000 BTC of its customer's funds were lost (2.3).

Trading was resumed on January 3, 2013, while the old balances originating before December 21, 2012 were put on hold and cannot be withdrawn or traded.
 (2.4). The site operator announced that he is looking for investors to repay the creditors and that he is willing to handle out the control over the exchange to the investors in that case.
