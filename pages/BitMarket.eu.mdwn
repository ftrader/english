A [[currency_exchange]] site serving those trading between bitcoins and the following currencies:

* EUR (Euro)
* PLN (Polish ZÅ‚oty)
* GBP (British Pound Sterling)
* USD (United States Dollar)
* CAD (Canadian Dollar)
* AUD (Australian Dollar)
* RUB (Russian Ruble)
* CHF (Swiss Franc)
* ZAR (South African Rand)
* ILS (Israeli Shekel)

The order book contains only sell orders and buy orders are not accepted unless there is a corresponding sell order at that price.  Payment (e.g., wire transfer) is then coordinated between buyer and seller.

The service was announced April 5th, 2011 (1.1).  On March 26, 2012 the order system was changed so that buy orders had to execute immediately (1.2).
