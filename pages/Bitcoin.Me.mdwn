**Bitcoin.me** is a fee-based URL shortening service.  Any url prefix and path suffix combination that has not yet been registered on the bitcoin.me domain may be established through this service.  For example, the fee of 1 BTC was paid so that the URL [[http://wiki.bitcoin.me_Wiki.Bitcoin.Me]] would redirect to [[this Wiki site|Bitcoin]].

##Criticism

Any redirect can be outbid thus causing not only the original payment amount to be lost, but for any successive visits to the URL to go to the newly purchased redirect target.
