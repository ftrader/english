**DarkWallet** is an experimental, [[privacy]]-focused bitcoin [[client]] initially developed by [[Amir_Taaki]], Cody Wilson and others.

The software is written in JavaScript and runs as an extension for Google's Chrome browser.

The project gained significant media attention for its use of modern [[BIP_0032]] [[wallet]] format and privacy-preserving features such as [Stealth Payments](http://sx.dyne.org/stealth.html), and passive [[CoinJoin]] mixing, development on the project has waned and it appears to be abandoned.  The last release was [Darkwallet Alpha 8](https://github.com/darkwallet/darkwallet/releases/tag/0.8.0) ([announcement on iki](https://wiki.unsystem.net/en/index.php/DarkWallet/Alpha8)) on Jan 23, 2015.
