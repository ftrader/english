A market for renting "Hash Power". It buys and/or sells hash power normally used for bitcoin [[mining]].
The price of hash power is often more than its "worth in bitcoin" (= the amount of bitcoin it is expected to generate).

One example of such a marketplace was [GPUMAX](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=55819.0), ran by [[Pirateat40]].

Hash markets can be used to obtain large amounts of hash power, in order to perform various attacks that require high hash rate against some alt-chains (or theoretically bitcoin itself).
