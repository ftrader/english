## Editing on the wiki

In order to create a page or edit an existing page, you need to create an account first.

Unless you are absolutely sure of the information you are trying to bring in, it is recommended to use the discussion page to suggest your changes.

### Wiki formatting

More information on wiki formatting is provided on the [Mediawiki Formatting help page](http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Help:Formatting).
