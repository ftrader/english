Bit Innovate is an Australian owned initiative promoting Bitcoin and providing innovative services to the Bitcoin community.

Bit Innovates first offering was its Buy Bitcoins service which facilitates the purchase of Bitcoins with Australian Dollars (AUD) by accepting cash deposits at a Bank branch. This fast and easy to use local service resolves the need for individuals to send money overseas to international Bitcoin exchanges, by providing a fast and safe way to buy Bitcoins in Australia.

On the 13th of January 2013 Bit Innovate launched their Sell Bitcoins service that allows users to sell bitcoins for AUD at 0% commission on MtGox Ask rate for AUD.
