Bit Innovate is an Australian owned initiative promoting Bitcoin and providing innovative services to the Bitcoin community.

Bit Innovates first offering was its Buy Bitcoins service which facilitates the purchase of Bitcoins with Australian Dollars (AUD) by accepting cash deposits at a Bank branch. This fast and easy to use local service resolves the need for individuals to send money overseas to international Bitcoin exchanges, by providing a safe, anonymous and legal way to buy Bitcoins in Australia.

Their latest offering is Bit:anything BETA. A service which allows users in Australia to buy almost anything with Bitcoins.
