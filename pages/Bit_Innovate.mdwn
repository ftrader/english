Bit Innovate is an Australian owned initiative with the intention to promote and provide innovative services for Bitcoin.

Our first offering was our Buy Bitcoins service which facilitates the purchase of Bitcoins with Australian Dollars (AUD) by accepting cash deposits at a Bank branch. This fast and easy to use local service resolves the need for individuals to send money overseas to international Bitcoin exchanges, by providing a safe, anonymous and legal way to buy Bitcoins in Australia.

Our latest offering is our Bit:anything BETA service which allows users in Australia to buy almost anything with Bitcoins.

Bit Innovate is located in Sydney, Australia and run by a group of IT professionals
