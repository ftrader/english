BitcoinBox.nl has been established in April 2015 and offers cloud servers exclusively for Bitcoin. The servers are located in the Netherlands. The plans at BitcoinBox.nl come in increments of 100 GB storage, 30 GB backup storage and 1 IPv4 address. Each increment allows for an additional separate cloud server. If you decide to take for example 400 GB storage, 120 GB backup storage and 4 IPv4 addresses, you can allocate these freely to 1-4 virtual servers. The control panel offers features like power management, a web console and installation of operating systems.
