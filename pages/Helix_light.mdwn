The Helix Light system is very simple. Give us the address you want the bitcoins sent to. We give you an address to send them to. You have 4 hours to send 1 transaction between .02 and 6 bitcoins. We will take a 3% fee and send you brand new coins.

After the intial transaction you send to Helix has 3 confirmations, the coins will be cleaned and sent back to you with 1 transaction immediately. The process can take up to 2 hours, but because of reserve clean coins, 95% of all helixes are sent with in 30 minutes.
