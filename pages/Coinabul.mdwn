Coinabul is the only true Bitcoin-to-Gold exchange in the world. Bitcoin users are able to trade in bitcoins to their national currency via currency exchanges,
but for users who prefer to save their money in gold, Coinabul provides instant gold purchasing capabilities. Instead of trying to convert bitcoins to their
local currency, withdraw that currency, and buy gold in a separate transaction, one can simply purchase gold on Coinabul.
To give users a competitive edge on the markets Coinabul fetches Bitcoin and gold spot prices automatically and prices all items within Coinabul appropriately.
Created recently, this company has built a solid website dedicated to providing a secure environment for commodity exchange.
Coinabul was founded inside the United States and is dedicated to transparency and safety.
