A market where traded are options to buy and sell bitcoins at future points in time.

The option exchange is still considered Beta and some changes to how trading occurs are still possible.  As of June 19, 2011 the option expirations occur weekly.  Options are listed following European style (exercised only at expiration) though some options following the American style traded back when that method was allowed will still be seen until they expire.

All options written are backed by full escrow committed by the option writer at the time the option was offered.  Funds in escrow are held in the organization's account with [[MtGox]] exchange.

The exchange completed its first weekly expiration on June 16th, 2011 (1.1).  The service was suspended shortly after for a redesign and as-of September 2011 the redesign was being "finalized", according to the site.
