##Possible Motives
He left some clues about why he is doing this project when he include the following text in the [[Genesis_block]], "The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks".
##Possible identity
Doubts are casted on his identity and/or nationality. While the few informations available about him point to Japan, he never wrote a single line of Japanese, the Bitcoin client has no Japanese version and there is no Japanese page on [bitcoin.org](http://bitcoin.org).
