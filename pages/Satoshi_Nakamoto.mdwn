**Satoshi Nakamoto** is the pseudonymous entity that designed and created the original [[Bitcoin]] software, currently known as [[Bitcoin-Qt]]. Nakamoto is often claimed to be a veil for a group of people.

His involvement in the original [[Bitcoin]] software does not appear to extend past mid-2010.

##Identity

There are no records of Nakamoto's identity or identities prior to the creation of [[Bitcoin]]. On his [[P2P_foundation]] profile, Nakamoto claimed to be an individual male at the age of 37 and of [[Japanese]] origin, which was met with great skepticism due to his use of English and his Bitcoin [[software]] not being documented nor labeled in Japanese. (2.1)

British formatting in his written work implies Nakamoto is of British origin.

The first release of his original [[Bitcoin]] software is speculated to be of a collabrative effort, leading some to claim that Satoshi Nakamoto was a collective pseudonym for a group of people. (2.2)

##Work
In 2008, Nakamoto published a paper (3.1) (3.2) on The Cryptography Mailing list at metzdowd.com (3.3) describing the Bitcoin digital currency. In 2009, he released the first [[Bitcoin]] software that launched the network and the first units of the Bitcoin [[currency]]. (3.4) (3.5)  

Nakamoto continued to contribute to his Bitcoin software release with other developers until contact with his team and the community gradually began to fade in mid-2010. He gave all original Bitcoin properties and alert key functions of his software to [[Gavin_Andresen]] near this time.

##Motives

Nakamoto's work appears to be politically motivated, as quoted:

"Yes, [will not find a solution to political problems in cryptography,](we) but we can win a major battle in the arms race and gain a new territory of freedom for several years.Governments are good at cutting off the heads of a centrally controlled networks like Napster, but pure P2P networks like Gnutella and Tor seem to be holding their own." - Satoshi Nakamoto

"[is](Bitcoin) very attractive to the libertarian viewpoint if we can explain it properly. I'm better with code than with words though." - Satoshi Nakamoto

In the Bitcoin network's transaction database, the original entry has a note by Nakamoto that reads as:

"The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks"

Some claim this quote implies Nakamoto had great concern or contempt for the current [[central_banking]] system.

##Influence
The smallest unit of the [[Bitcoin]] currency (1/100,000,000) has been named "satoshi" in collective homage to his founding of [[Bitcoin]]. (5.1)
