**Satoshi Nakamoto** is the founder of [[Bitcoin]] and initial author of the [[Original_Bitcoin_client]]. He has said in a p2p foundation profile (1.1) that he is from Japan. Beyond that, not much is known about him.

##Possible Motives

He left some clues about why he is doing this project with the inclusion of the following text in the [[Genesis_block]], "The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks".

Some more interesting quotes:
<blockquote><p>Yes, [will not find a solution to political problems in cryptography,](we) but we can win a major battle in the arms race and gain a new territory of 
freedom for several years.</p>

<p>Governments are good at cutting off the heads of a centrally controlled 
networks like Napster, but pure P2P networks like Gnutella and Tor seem to be 
holding their own.</p></blockquote> [(1)](http://www.mail-archive.com/cryptography@metzdowd.com/msg09971.html)

<blockquote>It's very attractive to the libertarian viewpoint if we can explain it 
properly.  I'm better with code than with words though.</blockquote> [(2)](http://www.mail-archive.com/cryptography@metzdowd.com/msg10001.html)

##Possible identity

His identity and/or nationality are in doubt. While the few bits of information available (1.1) about him point to Japan, he never wrote a single line of Japanese, the Bitcoin client has no Japanese version and there is no Japanese page on [bitcoin.org](http://bitcoin.org).
