**Satoshi Nakamoto** is the pseudonymous person or group of people who designed and created the original [[Bitcoin]] software, currently known as [[Bitcoin-Qt]].

His involvement in the original [[Bitcoin]] software does not appear to extend past mid-2010.

##Identity

There are no records of Nakamoto's identity or identities prior to the creation of [[Bitcoin]]. On his [[P2P_foundation]] profile, Nakamoto claimed to be an individual male at the age of 37 and of [[Japanese]] origin, which was met with great skepticism due to his use of English and his Bitcoin [[software]] not being documented nor labeled in Japanese.

British formatting in his written work implies Nakamoto is of British origin. Though he also sometimes used American spelling, which may indicate that he was intentionally trying (but failed) to mask his writing style, or that he is more than one person.

The first release of his original [[Bitcoin]] software is speculated to be of a collabrative effort, leading some to claim that Satoshi Nakamoto was a collective pseudonym for a group of people.

##Work

Nakamoto has claimed that he has been working on Bitcoin since 2007. In 2008, he published a paper on The Cryptography Mailing list at metzdowd.com describing the Bitcoin digital currency. In 2009, he released the first [[Bitcoin]] software that launched the network and the first units of the Bitcoin [[currency]].

Nakamoto continued to contribute to his Bitcoin software release with other developers until contact with his team and the community gradually began to fade in mid-2010. He gave all original Bitcoin properties and alert key functions of his software to [[Gavin_Andresen]] near this time.

##Motives

Nakamoto's work appears to be politically motivated, as quoted:

"Yes, [will not find a solution to political problems in cryptography,](we) but we can win a major battle in the arms race and gain a new territory of freedom for several years. Governments are good at cutting off the heads of a centrally controlled networks like Napster, but pure P2P networks like Gnutella and Tor seem to be holding their own." - Satoshi Nakamoto

"[is](Bitcoin) very attractive to the libertarian viewpoint if we can explain it properly. I'm better with code than with words though." - Satoshi Nakamoto

In the Bitcoin network's transaction database, the original entry has a note by Nakamoto that reads as:

"The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks"

Some claim this quote implies Nakamoto had great concern or contempt for the current [[central_banking]] system.

##Influence
The smallest unit of the [[Bitcoin]] currency (1/100,000,000) has been named "satoshi" in collective homage to his founding of [[Bitcoin]].
