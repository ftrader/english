**Satoshi Nakamoto** is the founder of [[Bitcoin]] and initial author of the [[Original_Bitcoin_client]]. He has said in a p2p foundation profile (1.1) that he is from Japan. Beyond that, not much is known about him.

##Possible Motives

He left some clues about why he is doing this project with the inclusion of the following text in the [[Genesis_block]], "The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks".

##Possible identity

His identity and/or nationality are in doubt. While the few bits of information available (1.1) about him point to Japan, he never wrote a single line of Japanese, the Bitcoin client has no Japanese version and there is no Japanese page on [bitcoin.org](http://bitcoin.org).
