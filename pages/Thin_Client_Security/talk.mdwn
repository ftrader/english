Lapp0, please stop deleting my content, which has been on this wiki page for over three years now.  If you think it's suddenly no longer true, discuss here first.  In particular, you wrote:

	Transactions don't become more valid with more block preceding it's proof.

Chains become more trustworthy as they become (difficultywise-)longer.  This is the most basic principle of blockchain consensus.

I have to keep putting that "(difficultywise-)" in there so pedantic people don't pounce on me... a 100,000-block chain all at difficulty=1 is "difficultywise-shorter" than a 100-block chain at current difficulty levels (or a one-block chain for that matter).  It's not the number of blocks, but their total difficulty.

	The vagueness of what Full-chain is should be elaborated on probably explaining it uses SPV proofs

No, full-chain clients such as the Satoshi client do not use SPV in any way, shape, or form.  A full-chain client is a client that implements the main algorithm outlined in Satoshi's whitepaper.
