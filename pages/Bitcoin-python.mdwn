Friendly bitcoin API binding for Python.

bitcoin-python is a set of Python libraries that allows easy access to the Bitcoin peer-to-peer cryptocurrency client API.

This software is Open Source.

##Documentation
Documentation can be found here, or in the source archive. It is built using Sphinx:

http://laanwj.github.com/bitcoin-python/doc/

##PIP

The library can also be found in the Python package repository

https://pypi.python.org/pypi/bitcoin-python/0.3

This means that it can be installed using **pip install bitcoin-python**.

## Project status

According to [the PyPI page](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/bitcoin-python/0.3), bitcoin-python is not actively maintained. The page suggests using [python-bitcoinlib](https://github.com/petertodd/python-bitcoinlib) instead, which offers far more features.

The PyPI page for bitcoin-python leaves open the opportunity for anyone to take up the maintainer role for bitcoin-python, if they contact the developer.
