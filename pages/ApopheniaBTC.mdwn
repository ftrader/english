[Apophenia](https://apopheniabtc.com) (or ApopheniaBTC) is a game playable with bitcoins. The players are presented with distorted pictures and they try to guess what each picture shows. To guess they have to bet a fixed amount of money (that varies from picture to picture). The winner, i.e. the first one to guess correctly what the picture shows, wins the pot that is on the picture. The starting pot for each picture is paid by the site and a portion of all bets that are placed on the picture is also added to the pot.
