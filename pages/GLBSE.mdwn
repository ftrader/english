**GLBSE**

The GLBSE (pronounced glib-zee) was a form of exchange that provided services to users to sell assets, bitcoin bonds listed with the exchange.


##History

The site entered testing phase under an internal code name before being opened with a round 3 of testing on April 27, 2011 (2.1) and launch soon after.

A version 2.0 with a vastly revamped architecture was launched on March 24, 2012 (2.2).

On October 4, 2012 the service abruptly closed (2.3) and on October 9, 2012 described the method the service will follow for the return of all bitcoins held by the service -- with each accountholder being required to provide identification (2.4).
