**GLobal Bitcoin Stock Exchange**

The Global Bitcoin Stock Exchange is a form of exchange that provides services to brokers and traders to trade stocks, bonds and other securities list at the exchange.

Currently in development and testing it will allow people to:

	* Issue shares to raise capital
	* Pay dividends to shareholders
	* Put resolutions to shareholders and get their vote
	* Issue and sell bonds
	* Borrow from and lend to the market
	* And trade all of the above with other traders on the market

Additional features on the drawing board:

	* Make and recieve loan repayments
	* Issue futures contracts
	* Meta-trade on non listed companies (on other exchanges)

The service comes from the first bitcoin company BitcoinGlobal.  The site entered testing phase under an internal code name before being opened with a round 3 of testing on April 27, 2011 (1.1) and launch soon after.

A version 2.0 with a vastly revamped architecture was launched on March 24, 2012 (1.2).
