##Proposed Listing Standards
I propose the following standards be required for listing on the [[Trade]]. The listed site must

1. Be currently functional (downtime of less than 48 hours is acceptable)
1. Be currently accepting bitcoins
1. Have clear instructions for paying with bitcoins from the link given
1. Prices must be sane within an order of magnitude (non-sane prices indicate that the website has not been updated to match bitcoin deflation)
The standards will help keep the list manageable and easy to use.


This is a talk page, so please sign your contributions. I mostly agree, but the "sane prices" criterion seems a bit subjective ; there is a risk that we exclude goodwilling merchants, who would otherwise be willing to update their prices when contacted.

> Here is an example [[http://bitcoin2cash.com/]]. When I say "sane", I mean reasonable within an order of magnitude. I moved your other comment to a separate section for clarity [Ptd](User:Ptd) 12:59, 13 February 2011 (GMT)

Sounds reasonable. --[Sirius](User:Sirius) 07:09, 23 February 2011 (GMT)
Reasonable. What about defining a practice for ordering the list of sites? I've got one to add, so I'll just tack it at the bottom, but it's going to be an ugly list after awhile. Alphabetical? Chronologically ordered by add date?

##Should we put addresses on the wiki?
We just had some bitcoin address spam. perhaps it would not have happened if we did not put bitcoin addresses on the wiki ? [ThomasV](User:ThomasV) 23:50, 12 February 2011 (GMT)

Yea i suggest not to put the bitcoin addresses of donation-accepting orgs on the wiki. this opens it up to vandalism in hopes of getting misdirected bitcoins. just link to the relevant webpage of the donation-accepting organization, and that's all. that way also we don't have to worry about the addresses changing.--[Nanotube](User:Nanotube) 04:41, 24 February 2011 (GMT)

##Hide Contents of Adult?
Should the contents of Adult be displayed by default, or might it be reasonable to expect that to be a hidden that requires an action for the contents of the category to be rendered? - [[User:sgornick]] 06:22, 23 February 2011 (GMT)

Should be hidden or moved to another page. --[Sirius](User:Sirius) 07:05, 23 February 2011 (GMT)

I'm all for censoring it as much as the community will tolerate. --[Luke-jr](User:Luke-jr) 13:27, 23 February 2011 (GMT)

Why hide adult section? They are just links to sites, and section is clearly labeled "Adult". What's the big idea on the censorship? --[Nanotube](User:Nanotube) 04:39, 24 February 2011 (GMT)

I suggest do not censor or hide.  Consider for example genjix's calm reference to drugs in his presentation.  Should he have been afraid and contemplative of censoring or preventing from communicating such things?  Such is a kind of debate generally influenced by religi*** motivations.  See [[Trade_R]] for adult content [Mizerydearia](User:Mizerydearia) 15:04, 27 April 2011 (GMT)

Against censorship of site links. They should simply be labeled as adult oriented and the vagues possible genre references.

## Drugs Section Empty

The "psychoactives" section appears to consist entirely of dead links. [Ironwolf](User:Ironwolf) 03:54, 28 March 2011 (GMT)

I deleted the Drugs section, since Bitcoin is still far too vulnerable to government actions against it -- there are many single points of failure. The most glaring to me is the DNS system -- the bitcoin.org domain could be taken down if the US government wishes to.

I apologize to those merchants who may not get as many customers now, but really, it's probably better this way.  Anyone who needs to can get a connection by asking around, I'm sure. My goal is only to reduce the "criminal" perception of Bitcoin. [AaronM](User:AaronM) 01:18, 27 April 2011 (GMT)

## What is a Notable Website

I started accepting bitcoin at http://la.indymedia.org and a couple other sites on the slaptech.net site.  What's the standard for adding this to the list of sites? [Johnk](User:Johnk) 16:30, 17 April 2011 (GMT)

## New section for services that are not considered "Professional services"?

I'm wondering whether it might be advisable to add a section for services that are not really "professional services" as that term is ordinarily used in vernacular English.  

For example, I just added a dump-truck haulage service to *Professional services/Other*; but dump truck haulage is not generally considered a professional service.  Ought we to consider adding a new section to the page?  [1ECVX6EAk53VER2NH5NKharUUGpfw8iUP6](User:1ECVX6EAk53VER2NH5NKharUUGpfw8iUP6) 01:49, 4 May 2011 (GMT)

## donation accepting organizasions

perhaps a separate page should be created for them ?
I guess donations do not belong to "trade".
[ThomasV](User:ThomasV) 23:17, 5 May 2011 (GMT)

> Definitely. It's a bit sad that there is no place to list all Bitcoin-accepted organizations, particularly smaller non-profit ones since they don't sell anything and the organizations page has a notability requirement. I'll create one if no one objects and/or does it before me. [Blues](User:Blues) 20:36, 25 May 2011 (GMT)

## Alternative listings for bitcoin-related directory and merchant sites

Because this wiki  is censored and not allowing of certain contents or sites, I have set up http://bitcoinsites.witcoin.com/ to allow for all bitcoin-related sites to be posted.  Feel free to also use this medium for commenting and reviewing sites as well. [Mizerydearia](User:Mizerydearia) 05:28, 25 May 2011 (GMT)

* Since witcoin.com is subject to US and/or Canada law, I would expect it to be censored as well eventually. But perhaps not a bad idea to make an alternative site for the ratings/reviews idea anyway... I won't use it if it's based on witcoin though, since they require paying to comment/rate... --[Luke-jr](User:Luke-jr) 18:27, 25 May 2011 (GMT)


[Bitcookies](http://bitcookies.com) - A community resource to list businesses, events, and classifieds that are related to Bitcoin. The server is privately owned and therefore not subject to any controlling interests. The site does not, nor will it ever have censorship in terms of the types of businesses/traders/websites listed. The site is free to all community members and was developed with funds from my mining operations. [Miner24934](User:Miner249er) 16:25, 27 May 2011 (GMT)
