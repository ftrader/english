##Proposed Listing Standards
I propose the following standards be required for listing on the [[Trade]]. The listed site must

* Be currently functional (downtime of less than 48 hours is acceptable)
* Be currently accepting bitcoins
* Have clear instructions for paying with bitcoins from the link given
The standards will help keep the list manageable and easy to use.

Opinions:

* I think this is a great idea, just how I would have written them (well I did :) [Ptd](User:Ptd) 17:38, 11 February 2011 (GMT)
