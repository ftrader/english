Bitomat is the first Polish [[exchange|currency_exchange]] offering PLN support.

Traders deposit funds (PLN or BTC) to the site and then place orders to buy and sell. Bitomat acts as an escrow.

Funds are credited after each transaction immediately to accounts wherein they can be withdrawn off-site.

Usually it takes just a few minutes to transfer PLN from/to bank account (as long as its [mBank](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MBank) bank account).

##History
The exchange went online on April 4, 2011. (2.1)
