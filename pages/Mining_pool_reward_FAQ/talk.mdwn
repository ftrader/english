##Content dispute

I think this revision by holy-fire is the best.
https://en.bitcoin.it/w/index.php?title=Mining_pool_reward_FAQ&oldid=8977

all it needs is a citation to the whitepaper describing the pool hopping attack
and also a citation to the closing of bitpenny, which is strongly suspected, on statistical grounds, by that pool's operator, of being due to griefing (real-block withholding).

Subject to further user comments, i plan to revert the page to this revision. --[Nanotube](User:Nanotube) 20:25, 26 May 2011 (GMT)

* That revision contains FUD about pool-hopping on share-based pools (it is not an attack, and is not cheating). The only time pool-hopping creates unfair rewards is when score-based pools are involved. It also discounts as a myth, the fact that share-based pools are disadvantageous to intermittent miners. --[Luke-jr](User:Luke-jr) 20:32, 26 May 2011 (GMT)


##Pool-hopping
I strongly object to having Pool-Hopping included in this article. It's a way of cheating the system. It's a system that increases how much you make at the expense of others who are earning it in a more fair way. If pool-hopping can directly cause a system to FAIL, it should NOT be advertised as a good way to earn more bitcoins --<span style="text-shadow:orange 0px 0px 3px;"><font color="#FF6600"><tt><big><u>****</u></big></tt></font>[Firestorm](User:Firestorm)</span> 23:10, 26 May 2011 (GMT)
