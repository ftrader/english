Cleanbit is a mixing service which launched in May of 2012. Their mixing proceedure uses clusters of wallets to mix coins and guarantee none of your own coins are returned to you. They also have the option for PGP encryption for each transaction to hide the incoming/outgoing addresses of a mixing transaction.

They recommend using bitcoin coupled with a socks proxy or TOR when mixing to maximize anonymity.
