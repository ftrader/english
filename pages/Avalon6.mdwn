# Basic Information
	Hashrate:
	**3.65T (+-10%)**
	
	Power consumption:
	990W (measure on 12V port of the device)
	1100W (on the wall, with assumption of 90% power conversion ratio)
	
	Power per hash:
	270J/THash (device only)
	295J/THash (on the wall, with assumption of 90% power conversion
	ratio)
	
	Overclocking:
	Support automatically optimize frequency, no need to overclock manually.
	
	PSU ouput pin:
	4x6PIN PCIe power connector. *All must be connected.*
	
	PSU requirements:
	Minimum 1100W output, recommend to use high quality PSU for server
	with more than 1200W output and high quality power cable.
	Input voltage no lower than 11.7V and no higher than 12.2V (numbers
	take from the controller)
	Lower voltage leads to lower hashrate and higher voltage leads to
	possible device burning down.
	NOTICE: Poor quality cable may result in low voltage.
	
	Fan:
	Specs: 12038
	Current: between 1.6A and 2.8A.
	Minimum RPM: 3800.
	*NOTICE* If the fan is broken or the fan's RPM cannot be measure,
	the device will not start.
	
	Controller:
	Raspberry Pi (version B or B+)
	Raspberrt Pi 2 is not supported yet.
	Each RPi can control approximate 60 devices.
	
	AUC:
	Each AUC can connect up to 6 devices.
	
	Dimensions:
	354x136x150mm
	
	Net weight:
	~4.2kg
	
	Protection Degree:
	IP20

## LED
	Power on: White
	Hashing: Blue
	Idle: Yellow blinking
	Detect fan: Green blinking
	Error(Software, Power, Temperature): Red blinking
	Manually turn on LED: While blinking
