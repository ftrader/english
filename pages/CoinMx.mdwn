The Association was established in early 2013, with seven members and by October of 2013 has grown because of the digital money craze. Prior to adding our digital money exchange for our members, our association only had 200 members. From July 2013 until October 2014 our membership grew to 70,000 members.


The Coin.Mx site was developed by a group of our association members. They created the exchange so they could freely transact with one another without being scammed from outside sources. 

Coin.Mx allows you to buy bitcoin with cash, credit card, bank transfers, Domestic & International wires and free ACH withdrawls.
