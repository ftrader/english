Why wait to extend divisibility until we need it? It's easier to upgrade >50% now.

Note: 1 Satoshi is defined to be the present base unit, or 0.00000001 BTC

## Proposed solutions
### 62/64-bit
In these solutions, a 64-bit type is assumed, one of which is reserved for signedness (+/-), and another for an "upgraded" flag to retain compatibility with the existing block chain.

#### "B"
Each Satoshi is upgraded to 2079 (3 × 3 × 3 × 7 × 11) base units.

* Adds 3 more decimal places
* Can be divided into exact ⅓, ⅙, ⅐, ⅑, 1⁄11 (in addition to the present ½ and ⅕) and multiples thereof

#### "D"
Each Satoshi is upgraded to 1296 (3 × 3 × 3 × 3 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2) base units.

* Adds 3 more decimal places
* Can be divided into exact ⅓, ⅑, (in addition to the present ½ and ⅕) and multiples thereof

In addition, after the initial 210000 blocks, generation will be reduced to 33.93554406716 BTC (4,398,046,511,104 new-base-units, which divides cleanly by 2 until exhausted) instead of the current 25 BTC.

* Inflation is increased. New mining reward is adjusted for this inflation, but all 50 BTC mining is devalued slightly over a long period of time.
* There are now a total of 24,752,928.50820579 BTC (3,207,979,534,663,470,000 new-base-units) to ever exist.

### Primes7,7,11,13,17,19,23,29
#### "A"
12 bits remain after 51 amount + 1 sign.

* Four ⅓ divisors
* Two 1⁄7 divisors
* 1⁄11
* 1⁄13
* 1⁄17
* 1⁄19
* 1⁄23
* 1⁄29

#### "B"
Limit transactions to 5.6 million BTC max.
This gives a total of 14 spare bits.

* Same as above, plus:
* 1⁄31
* 1⁄37

## Deprecated solutions
### 62/64-bit
#### "A"

* Satoshi × 2304 (2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 3 × 3)
* 21.47483648 BTC rewards
#### "C"

* Satoshi × 2187 (3 × 3 × 3 × 3 × 3 × 3 × 3)
