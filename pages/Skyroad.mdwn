Skyroad has its own economy called Taler and allows players to payout them. It is possible to use the Server as Faucet, voting every day gives the player a minimum of 400 Taler (0,00004) and five pieces Fortune Cookies, which can contain more Money.

Active Players can get more Money by playing: farming Resources, playing Jump and Runs (1.1), gambling and transactions with other Players.

##Voting
The server is listed in a Minecraft Serverlist (2.1) and can get on the top of the List for votes.
To Vote, use the Command /help at the Spawnpoint of the Server and click on the chat message "[[Voten]]", after that, navigate to "Jetzt voten" and get the Money.

##Gambling
Players who like to test their luck, can play on the Servers Casino.
There are some Slot machines, Hi/Lo Dice Game, Minefield Game and Skill Games. Use the Clock and click on the Gold Block to get teleported to the Casino.

##Get Bitcoins
To get the Money into Bitcoins, only three Steps (4.1) need to be taken:
1. Type in your Bitcoin Adress using /btc <address> (Example: /btc 1MaXZE92yjuy4NYjTspmdWHMRT3jQUcTf4)
2. Check the Adress using /payout (Check, if the Address is 100% correct, step forward.)
3. Use /payoutok <amount> to send the Money to the Address, use the Server Economy as amount. (Example: /payoutok 15000)

Skyroad is trying to send the Bitcoins very fast, but it can take in some cases up to 24 hours for an approval.
