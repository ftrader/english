Karsha Mobile Payment Interface is a lightweight interface optimized for mobile phone's small screens and limited capabilities to access e-currency accounts. This interface is currently accessible via http://m.karsha.biz or https://karsha.biz/m addresses.

### Openning a Karsha Bitcoin account
Karsha Bitcoin accounts are similar to other normal Bitcoin accounts with these differences:

* The user doesn't need to install any software on his/her computer or mobile phone.
* There is no need to stay connected to network to be noticed by received payments.
* Any user has the ability to use [[Karsha_Shopping_Cart_Interface]] as an easy way to accept Bitcoin payments.
* There is a constant fee of BTC 0.01 to sending payments or paying through the shopping cart interface which will be deducted from the sender account.
To open a new Karsha Bitcoin account, you must visit http://m.karsha.biz or https://karsha.biz/m via your mobile phone's browser and click on the "Sign Up" button.
