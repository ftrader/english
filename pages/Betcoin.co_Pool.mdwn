**Betcoin.co Pool**, also sometimes referred to 'Somebadger's pool', is a [[mining pool|Pooled_mining]].

Betcoin's Mining Pool uses an anti cheating scoring system.

Older shares (from beginning of the round) have a lower weight than newer shares, which serves to demotivate a cheater from switching between pools inside a round.

Balances accumulate on the server, and are sent out when a user-set threshold balance is reached or the user or manually requested.

There is a fee of 1% for the 1st block and this will be awarded to the person who finds that block.
