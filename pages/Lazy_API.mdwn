For the incredibly lazy and/or incompetent web developer, I present the lazy man's bitcoin API (copied from [a forum post](http://www.bitcoin.org/smf/index.php?topic=4324.msg77187#msg77187)):

**Problem:** 

Lazy web designer (me) wants to use bitcoins without dealing with installing bitcoin on a server, installing a shopping cart interface, or using ugly merchant services with callbacks.

**Solution for sending bitcoins:**

Use the [MtGox API](https://mtgox.com/support/tradeAPI)

**Solution for receiving bitcoins:**

1. Input a list of bitcoin receiving addresses to your database
1. Give a bitcoin address to a potential customer
1. Have the customer tell you when they have sent the coins and have at least 1 confirmation (you can choose a number higher than 1 if you are worried about double-spending)
1. Check blockexplorer to see if they sent the right amount (i.e. http://blockexplorer.com/q/getreceivedbyaddress/19hMEAaRMbEhfSkeU4GT8mgSuyR4t4M6TH/1) - the /1 is the number of confirmations you require
1. Give them what they paid for
1. After a reasonable amount of time has passed, you can re-use the address for another customer

You could avoid having a list of addresses and reusing them if one of the wallet services someday lets you get a new address via API call, but this will work for now.

**Bad idea:**

Selling bars of gold this way (owner of blockexplorer.com could rip you off)

**Good(?) idea:**

Selling naked pictures of your grandma this way (owner of blockexplorer.com won't bother)

**Shameless begging:**
