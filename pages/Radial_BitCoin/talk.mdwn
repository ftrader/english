## deletion suggestion

As much as I love the irony of this article, I feel that given it's reasonable to delete the tonal bitcoin article, it also must mean that it's reasonable to delete this one too. I think they should either both be deleted or neither. So, if people are happy to vote, and consider this a vote for both tonal and radial bitcoin, let the voting begin:-

* **delete** both tonal and radial bitcoin articles. Hopefully the necessary points have been made, and it's time to have a serious wiki on here now. --[Rebroad](User:Rebroad) 23:14, 20 March 2012 (GMT)
