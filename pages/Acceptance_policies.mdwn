Many businesses accept Bitcoins in exchange for their goods and services.  Their policies vary depending on what they sell and their flexibility in pricing their goods.  Here are some of the most common policies.

##Proportional price (PP)
Goods and services are priced as a percentage of some other factor.  For example, the MtGox trading fee is priced as a percentage of the trading volume.  Adjustments due to exchange rates are unnecessary or rare under this policy.

##Fixed Bitcoin price (FBP)
Goods and services are priced in BTC.  Price changes, when necessary, are considered manually.  This is common for goods and services that are sold exclusively in Bitcoins.

##Fixed Bitcoin price with reserve (FBPR)
Same as Fixed price in BTC, but the merchant reserves the right, during periods of high price volatility, to temporarily suspend acceptance of BTC, or to charge a price that leaves the customer bearing most of the risk.

##Last Trade Price (LAST)
Goods and services are priced in traditional currency (dollars/euro).  Bitcoins are used as a substitute for traditional currency.  A price believed to reflect the most recent trade on the exchanges is used.  A merchant reserves the right to apply this policy only to "typical" size transactions for that merchant.

Websites may present LTP pricing in the form of external images that are automatically updated by a web service to compute a BTC price from the exchange rates in real time.

##Best Bid (BB)
Goods and services are priced in traditional currency (dollars/euro).  Bitcoins are used as a substitute for traditional currency.  The highest unsatisfied bid price shown on the exchanges is used as an exchange rate.  A merchant reserves the right to apply this policy only to "typical" size transactions for that merchant.

##Midpoint between Best Bid and Best Ask (MID)
Goods and services are priced in traditional currency (dollars/euro).  Bitcoins are used as a substitute for traditional currency.  The midpoint between the highest unsatisfied bid price and the lowest unsatisfied ask price shown on the exchanges is used as an exchange rate.  A merchant reserves the right to apply this policy only to "typical" size transactions for that merchant.

##Recent Weighted Trade Price (RWTP)
Goods and services are priced in traditional currency (dollars/euro).  Bitcoins are used as a substitute for traditional currency.  A price believed to reflect a weighted average of recent trades on the exchanges is used.  The actual formula is not defined by the policy, but typically tracks trading activity over the past few hours.

A merchant reserves the right to apply this policy only to "typical" size transactions, and to suspend acceptance of Bitcoins during periods of high volatility.

##Liquidation Price (LIQ)
Goods and services are priced in traditional currency (dollars/euro), and Bitcoins are credited strictly for the traditional currency that can be obtained on the exchanges by selling the Bitcoins immediately at the time the trade is made.  In many cases, this is exactly what happens.
