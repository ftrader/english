## Introduction

You can have different addresses in order to receive payments. Think of addresses as multiple postboxes around the outside of your house. Bitcoin allows accounts too. Each account owns a bunch of addresses. Taking our earlier analogy, you can imagine separate accounts as different houses. You (Bitcoin user) receive all the mail (balance shown in Bitcoin). Mail goes to a postbox (address) at one of your houses (accounts).
