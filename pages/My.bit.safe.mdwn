Formerly an escrow-like service that allows safer payment by securely holding a buyer's coins in escrow until the coins are released by the buyer.

If the coins are not released, they are donated to the [[Bitcoin_Faucet]] after thirty days have passed.  MyBitSafe provides no other dispute resolution services.

##History

The site was launched on July 10th, 2011 (2.1).  The service is defunct, as-of at least March 18th, 2012.
