Lets clear up common Bitcoin misconceptions.

## The bitcoin is backed by CPU cycles

Bitcoin is not backed by anything. It is a commodity in its own right. Is gold backed by anything? No! It's just gold. Same thing with bitcoin.

The Bitcoin currency is protected when adequate [[computing power|Weaknesses#Attacker_has_a_lot_of_computing_power]] exists.

## Bitcoins have no intrinsic value (unlike some other things)

## Bitcoins are illegal because it's not legal tender

## Bitcoin is a form of domestic terrorism because it only harms the economic stability of the USA and its currency

## Bitcoins can be printed/minted by anyone and are therefore worthless

## Bitcoins are worthless because it's based on unproven cryptography

Same cryptography as everything else.

## Early adopters are unfairly rewarded

## 21 million coins isn't enough, doesn't scale

## Lost coins can't be replaced. And this is bad.

## It's a giant ponzi scheme

Not to be confused with the [[Bitcoin Randomizer|Bitcoin_randomizer]] which really is a Ponzi scheme.

## Deflationary spiral
As deflationary forces may apply, economic factors such as hoarding are offset by human factors that may lessen the chances that a [[Deflationary_spiral]] will occur.

## Bitcoin community are anarchist/conspiracy theorist/gold standard weenies

## Anyone with enough computing power can take over the network

## Bitcoin violates some sort of government regulations

## Fractional reserve banking is not possible

## Point of sale with bitcoins isn't possible because of the 10 minute wait for confirmation

## After 21 million coins are mined, no one will run network nodes
