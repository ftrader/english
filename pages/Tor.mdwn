Tor is a distributed 'onion' network, that makes it more difficult for an adversely to track any one peer on this network.  Tor also is very useful to access the 'uncensored' internet in countries such as China and Iran.

Bitcoin can run easily on the Tor network.

Conducting business using bitcoin-otc can be done more anonymously when directly connected to a Freenode IRC hidden service.
