CALLEBITCOIN is an initiative started in Madrid, Spain in June 2014 to create a "Bitcoin Street" in which 20 physical merchants from the same street start to accept Bitcoin, following the model of BitcoinKiez (Berlin), Bitcoinstad (Arhem) or Bitcoin Boulevard.


The project started in the Bitcointalk forums, but now has its own website and social media presence:
