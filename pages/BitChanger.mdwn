BitChanger is a user-to-user, auction-based currency exchange. Sellers list their currency on the site, buyers will bid on the currency. The winning bidder is the highest bidder when the auction ends. All transactions are facilitated between buyer and seller. This eliminates the need for charging a fee and enables BitCoin users to take full control of their coins.

###About
This works similar to an exchange like Mt Gox or Tradehill, but you get to choose from whom you buy or sell. This also establishes a reputation system so that your transactions are secure. You can leave feedback for each user in the transaction to let others know who to trust.

The auction system is run by the members. If you are selling currency, you are able to set how long you wish to leave your listing active. You can also choose a buy-it-now option. Upon check-out, the winning bidder will be given a BitCoin receiving address (or whatever payment method was chosen to use to fund the transaction.)

##Buying
1.)Register an account at Bitchanger.
2.)(browse for currency to buy) and select the currency you wish to purchase.
3.)Place a bid on your selected currency and wait for the auction to end. We only use proxy bidding, to ensure that you receive the biggest bang for your buck.
4.) Once the auction has ended and you have successfully won the currency auction, you will be presented with various payment options based on the currency.
5.)Complete the payment, once it has cleared the seller will release your funds. Please contact us if there are any issues with the transactions. We insure all smaller amounts, but larger transactions are only insure on a percent to size ratio.
