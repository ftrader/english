An escrow-like service that allows safer payment by securely holding a buyer's coins in escrow until the terms of the sale are met and as a result the buyer releases payment to the seller.

To release the escrow amount, the buyer sends the 1% commission to the escrow service.  If the buyer does not release the escrow, the full escrowed amount is returned to the buyer after 30 days.

##Fees

The service charges a 1% fee, which is paid at the time the escrow is to be released to the seller.

##History

The site was launched on May 30th, 2011 (3.1).
