Might I suggest, just for the technicality of the issue, that "deflation" is actually the contraction of the *money supply*, not the effect of rising values and prices dropping. By the same token, inflation is an *increase* in the money supply, which then results in higher prices and lower values on money. We use deflation/inflation to refer to the *effects* of the phenomenon, but it is actually the increase or decrease that is meant by inflation or deflation.

Just a technicality.
