## Bithome.co (Scam site)
Bithome scams users by offering to "buy" Bitcoin with PayPal, Skrill, MoneyGram, Western Union and SEPA / Wire transfer. Also users can "sell" Bitcoins, NOT.

**This is a SCAM, do not use!**

If you send any money, it will be gone and you will not hear back from them. In case of PayPal money is collected as "friend+family" payment and can not be charged back.

PayPal fraud team is aware, but did not do anything about it for months (01/2016). Additionally, the site uses Cloudflare and other technologies to cloak its origin. The contact address equals the one of bitin.co Scam.
