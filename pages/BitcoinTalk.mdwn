The Bitcoin Forum is a message board where people interested in the technical details and the development of Bitcoin software can talk to each other. The forum also has places for people who are interested in bitcoin [[mining|tags/Mining]], in trading with bitcoin, and in the economics of Bitcoin.

The forum is owned by [[Sirius]]. It is administrated by [[theymos|:User:Theymos]], Sirius, and [[Gavin|:User:Gavinandresen]].

##History

Before the creation of the current Bitcoin Forum, Satoshi used a SourceForge forum. When Sirius provided hosting, the forum was moved to bitcoin.org/smf. Satoshi made several custom modifications to the forum software and theme.

The forum was at some point moved to forum.bitcoin.org. The bitcoin.org domain name was also transferred from Satoshi to Sirius.

In July, 2011 the forum was moved to bitcointalk.org in order to make it explicitly unofficial. The "forum" link on the bitcoin.org homepage now simply returns the Google search results for the search terms "bitcoin forums".

Satoshi's first non-test post on the forum:

<blockquote><p>I left the admin account set to the original SMF theme so if I somehow completely wedge the custom theme I can still get in to fix it.</p>

<p>I've got a neat little 12x12 coin image to replace those pip stars with.  Should look nice.  Also some nice button images to try.</p>

<p>The registration page has "hide your e-mail address" unchecked by default.  I must fix that in php before we can open up.</p>

<p>The Announcements forum is currently moderator access only.</p></blockquote>
