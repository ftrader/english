The Bitcoin Forum is a message board where people interested in the technical details and the development of Bitcoin software can talk to each other. The forum also has places for people who are interested in bitcoin [[mining]], in trading with bitcoin, and in the economics of Bitcoin.

Before the creation of the current Bitcoin Forum, a SourceForge forum was used.
