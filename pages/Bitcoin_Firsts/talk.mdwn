sgornick: any reason the 'bitcoin first' page is separate from the older History page?
[[/quote]]

Ya, probably so that the History page was more specific to bitcoin, but firsts was for trivia and only true firsts.

Like maybe going to v0.6 release is enough to make it into the History, but not something that would go into firsts.
At the same time, the first food truck to start using bitcoin might be something suitable for the Firsts page but would be extraneous in the Bitcoin History page.
