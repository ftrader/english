The BCCAPI (BitCoin Client API) is a java library designed for making secure light-weight bitcoin clients. The BCCAPI connects to a server that holds the block chain, and which tracks the client’s wallet balance. The server only has knowledge of the clients public keys, and is in no position to spend funds owned by the client’s wallet.

Features include:
Deterministic private keys
Zero backup
Low bandwidth
Low CPU usage
Server cannot spend your coins
Open source
Free service, running on donations

Simply put the API is designed for making it easy to create light-weight secure Bitcoin wallets for handheld devices.

The sources include a very simple console based client, that shows how to use it. I am not an Android developer, and my hope is that the community will pick this up and make some great apps.
