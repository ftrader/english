It achieved significant support after prematurely adopting [[BIP 101|BIP_0101]], making it an important proponent of the [[block_size_limit_controversy]]. (1.1)

After [[Gavin_Andresen]]'s resignation from the position of [[Bitcoin_Core]] maintainer, he and [[Mike_Hearn]] organized[[!template id=when]] Bitcoin XT. (1.2)

##Block size hard fork
In 2010, a block size limit was introduced into Bitcoin by [[Satoshi_Nakamoto]]. He added it as a safety measure to prevent miners from spamming large blocks and meant for it to be removed once secure lightweight wallets were developed.

There has been much community [[debate|Block_size_limit_controversy]] on this topic. You can read analysis and explanations for why we think raising the block size limit is important here:

##Miners
Miners that side with Bitcoin XT will produce blocks with a new version number. (3.1) This indicates to the rest of the network that they support XT. (3.1) When 75% of the last 1000 blocks are new-version blocks, these miners will automatically abandon Bitcoin and begin mining on a new Bitcoin XT blockchain. (3.1) This will begin after a waiting period of two weeks in hopes the economy in this time may force anyone who hasn't switched yet to do so. (3.1)
