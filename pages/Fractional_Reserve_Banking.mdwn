Fractional Reserve Banking is the practice whereby a bank holds reserves that are a fraction of its on-demand liabilities. It contrasts with a [[Full_Reserve_Banking]] system in which banks must hold reserves for 100% of on-demand liabilities.

Holding only a fraction of on-demand liabilities means that in the event of a bank-run the bank is mathematically unable to meet its obligations.
