Complementing to the [[Real_world_shops]] page, which contains a map of shops accepting Bitcoin, this page will contain a list of organizations that have existed before Bitcoin was created, and has started to accept Bitcoin payments or donations.

	- [Mezza Grill](http://www.mezzagrill.com/home/)
	- [Diaspora](https://joindiaspora.com/), the p2p Facebook alternative, are [accepting Bitcoin donations](https://www.diasporafoundation.org/donate).
	- [Wiki Leaks](http://wikileaks.org/) accept [Bitcoin donations](http://shop.wikileaks.org/donate)

wikileaks and diaspora are not exactly businesses or online shops . . .
