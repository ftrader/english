[Libbitcoin](http://libbitcoin.org) is a set of cross platform, open source C++ libraries for building bitcoin applications. The toolkit consists of libraries, examples, tests and applications. The project was established on three principles (1.1):

* Privacy: Bitcoin should always remain as private as possible for its users.
* Scalability: Bitcoin built today with the future in mind.
* Integrity: No individual or group should have enough power over the network to compromise its original aims.


##Status
Libbitcoin is actively maintained. Since version 2.0 the original projects of [[Libbitcoin|Libbitcoin_Common]], [[Obelisk|Libbitcoin_Server]] and [[SX|Libbitcoin_Explorer]] have been rationalized under a common repository, taxonomy and build system (2.1).

Libbitcoin includes the dedicated consensus library [[Libbitcoin Consensus|Libbitcoin_Consensus]]. This library provides a clean interface to the 34 source and header files from Bitcoin Core considered consensus critical. It also includes Python and Java SWIG (2.2) bindings. The use of this library is optional when building [[Libbitcoin Blockchain|Libbitcoin_Blockchain]].

Signed single file application binaries are available for [[Bitcoin Explorer|Libbitcoin_Explorer]] (2.3) and [[Bitcoin Server|Libbitcoin_Server]] (2.4) for Linux, OSX and Windows platforms. Extensive end-user and developer documentation is provided for Bitcoin Explorer (2.5).

Libbitcoin repositories include standard Autotools builds supporting GCC and Clang as well as robust Visual Studio solutions. Single file install scripts for Linux/OSX can download and build all dependencies and repositories (2.6). Linux and OSX builds are regularly tested on Travis-CI (2.7). Tests are executed following each automated build and subsequent reports are published through Coveralls (2.8).

Libbitcoin has been deployed on ARM devices, such as Airbitz iOS and Android applications which are built using [[libbitcoin|Libbitcoin_Common]] and [[libbitcoin-client|Libbitcoin_Client]] (2.9). There are a number of community Bitcoin Server deployments, including those maintained by Airbitz and Coinkite (2.10).

##Libbitcoin Libraries

* [[libbitcoin|Libbitcoin_Common]] (common)
* [[libbitcoin-blockchain|Libbitcoin_Blockchain]]
* [[libbitcoin-build|Libbitcoin_Build]]
* [[libbitcoin-client|Libbitcoin_Client]]
* [[libbitcoin-consensus|Libbitcoin_Consensus]]
* [[libbitcoin-explorer|Libbitcoin_Explorer]]
* [[libbitcoin-node|Libbitcoin_Node]]
* [[libbitcoin-protocol|Libbitcoin_Protocol]]
* [[libbitcoin-server|Libbitcoin_Server]]

##Libbitcoin Applications

* [[Bitcoin Explorer (bx)|Libbitcoin_Explorer]] - Bitcoin command line tool 
* [[Bitcoin Node (bn)|Libbitcoin_Node]] - Bitcoin full node (only)
* [[Bitcoin Server (bs)|Libbitcoin_Server]] - Blockchain service (and full node)

##History

* Libbitcoin was the second full implementation of [Bitcoin](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf), after the [[original client|Original_Bitcoin_client]]. It was created by a community of open source developers led by [[Amir Taaki|Amir_Taaki]] (genjix). (5.1)
* The first commits were by [[Patrick Strateman|Patrick_Strateman]] (phantomcircuit) on May 18, 2011 (5.2) and Libbitcoin was announced on July 21, 2011. (5.3)
* The related command line utility SubvertX (SX) was announced on November 2, 2011. (5.4)
* The related server Obelisk was first released on January 6, 2014, with an update to SX and the second major release of Libbitcoin. (5.5)
* SX was redesigned by [[Eric Voskuil|Eric_Voskuil]] (evoskuil) and released as [[Libbitcoin Explorer|Libbitcoin_Explorer]] (BX 2.0) on December 13, 2014. (5.6)
* [[Libbitcoin Server|Libbitcoin_Server]] (BS 2.0) was released on On May 9th, 2015, replacing Obelisk. A blockchain redesign by genjix substantially improved query performance (5.7).
