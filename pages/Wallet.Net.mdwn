A Secure Remote JSON-RPC BitCoin Wallet Management App Written in .Net.

##Features

* Full Featured GUI
* Ability to view/sort/filter transactions
* A full address book capability
* Ability to use the "Accounts" feature of bitcoin
* Sending Money
	* Using memos/notes
	* Using address book
	* With variable optional fee
* A full "RPC Shell" as I call it, providing a commandline like interface to the bitcoin JSON-RPC API.
* Built-in SSH Functionality (not requiring outside SSH client or certificate app). That provides the following: (note SSH is disabled currently due to some bugs)
	* Secure Encrypted Tunnel to the remote bitcoin host
	* Uses an already trusted service (SSH), and the associated daemon, which are typically very secure.
	* Limits potential attack vectors since on the bitcoin host, only SSH need be exposed. Making it virtually invisible (bitcoin is undetectable) to a potential attacker.
	* Your authentication through the tunnel is done over the encrypted channel.
