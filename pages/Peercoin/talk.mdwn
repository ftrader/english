## Criticisms points removed

I've removed the criticisms that were added back in December 2012 from the article. The first two criticisms were vague, and the third was resolved as of version 0.3.0.

* A hasty release of the coin - a whitepaper was released, and very quickly afterwards a blockchain was started, without giving ample time for people to even notice the coin exists.

* A centralized high frequency [[checkpointing]] mechanism "that will be removed once the coin is stable enough" (Bitcoin also uses Checkpoints, but their frequency is rather low).

* The coin's security model is not yet well understood by the community. One exploit is documented [in this thread](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=131940.0).
