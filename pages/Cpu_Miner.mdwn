[[!template id=stub]]**cpu-miner** is a Bitcoin miner created by jgarzik. It mines through a proprietary JSON-RPC pooled mining protocol, and supports several algorithms for doing encryption required to build a block.

##Algorithms

* **c:** Linux kernel (but not restricted to Linux) implementation of SHA256.
* **4way:** 128-bit SSE2 optimizations which are already available as a compile-time option on the classic Bitcoin client.
* **padlock:** Implementation of the Padlock encryption optimizations on VIA CPUs.
* **cryptopp:** (Experimental) algorithm which uses the Crypto++ library.
