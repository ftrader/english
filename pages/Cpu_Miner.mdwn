[[!template id=stub]]**cpu-miner** is a Bitcoin cpu miner created by jgarzik. It receives work through the standard JSON-RPC 'getwork' command, and supports several algorithms for doing encryption required to build a block.

##Algorithms

* **c:** Linux kernel (but not restricted to Linux) implementation of SHA256.
* **4way:** 128-bit SSE2 optimizations which are already available as a compile-time option on the classic Bitcoin client.
* **via:** Implementation of the Padlock encryption optimizations on VIA CPUs.
* **cryptopp:** C/C++ Implementation from the Crypto++ library.
* **cryptopp_asm32:** 32-bit assembly implementation from the Crypto++ library.
