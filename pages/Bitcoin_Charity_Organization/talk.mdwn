It's a "worldwide non-profit charity" that somehow has managed to generate no news articles, doesn't actually have a non-profit registration, and in fact, appears to be run completely anonymously. Their social pages are all locked to prevent anyone from commenting publicly. I've blanked the page until someone can prove this organization actually ever existed.
