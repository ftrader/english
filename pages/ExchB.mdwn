A [[currency_exchange]] market where bitcoins may be exchanged to and from U.S. dollars.  Exchange Bitcoins Inc. is a corporate entity registered with the State of California.

The site recently rebranded on the ExchB name and introduced a new logo and simplified layout.

ExchB has a simple look, strong security with two-factor authentication (1.1), and a well-documented API. Accounts can be funded with check, ING Direct Person2Person, wire transfer, and of course bitcoin. Orders executed on the site cause the USD and BTC account balances to be debited and credited in accordance with the amount and price of the order. All trades take place with funds that were previously deposited with the company.

##Trading
###Buying

A buy order is executed partially or in full when the price bid can be matched against a sell order that is at or below the bid amount.

###Selling

A sell order is executed partially or in full when the price asked can be matched against a buy order that is at or above the ask amount.

###Fees

Exchange Bitcoins subtracts a 0.54% commission from both the funds going to the buy and seller in each trade that is executed. The price reflected in the Transaction History is true price at which bitcoins were sold however the quantity of USD or BTC going into the account shown in the corresponding +/- column will be lower by the amount of the commission.
