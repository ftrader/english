A split-key vanity address is a type of [[vanity_address]] generated from one or more ECDSA private keys. The security of such solution is guaranteed by the properties of the Elliptic Curve Cryptography [(1)](http://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/q/3853/323).

## Address generation
A split-key vanity address is generated by a specialised software, called a generator. One such sample generator is available as a part of the [[Vanitygen]] program suite.

## Address merging
In order to create a usable vanity address, one needs to merge two or more private keys. This can be done with specialised software, such as the [[GoBit_Testing_Suite]][(1)](http://gobittest.appspot.com/).

## Address generation outsourcing
Generating a split-key vanity address can be outsourced to a third party miner without risking your final private key being compromised. Moreover, work on such address generation can be distributed to many miners simultaneously through a use of a pooling service. One example of such a service is [[Vanity_Pool]][(1)](https://vanitypool.appspot.com/).
