[TP's Bitcoin Calculator](http://tpbitcalc.appspot.com/) is a website created by [ThePiachu](User:ThePiachu), allowing anyone to calculate various aspects of their mining operations. It's an all-in-one solution, offering a quick run-down of how many bitcoins one can expect to generate with a given hardware, how much will their investment cost, whether it's profitable and how soon can they expect their investment to return its costs. The calculator is kept up to date on the latest network difficulty and exchange rate, allowing one to just plug in their hashing power and see all the information they might need before they start mining with their rig.
