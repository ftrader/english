## Skip IRC bootstrap?

As [said in the earlier stages of bitcoin](http://www.bitcoin.org/smf/index.php?topic=84.0) IRC is only a temporary solution for bootstrapping. Since I do not feel like implementing something that will be dropped soon after, I'd guess I should just skip the IRC bootstrap part and implement various other way to harvest initial nodes. I'm thinking of storing known peers in a database, and keeping those that stay most of the time (ie, got a fixed ip and provide bitcoin service). Any comment?

> Even if not often, some nodes are probably going to stay for years (the nodelist will start with the most long-established nodes). Once one node has been reached, things are easy [MagicalTux](User:MagicalTux) 03:17, 24 December 2010 (GMT)

## Suggestions

I've had various ideas for improvements for improving Bitcoin, but because I haven't written them down I've forgotten most of them. I'll try to keep a list here of ideas:

* Show small denominations of bitcoins using SI-notation. i.e 0.001 BTC = 1 mBTC, 100000 BTC = 0.1 GBTC
* Do not have accounts. Instead allow more flexible tree based method of organising addresses with ability to tag them in groups or categories.
* Basic libbitcoin so others can make clients for gtk, KDE ...
* Ability to generate at lower speeds
* Same one column for transaction amounts. Money sent is like -10 BTC and the row's background is highlighted red. Money received, the row is highlighed green and shown as +10 BTC. [Genjix](User:Genjix) 17:35, 24 December 2010 (GMT)
>  Ok let's see...
> * SI denomination: mostly cosmetic, why not. The difficult part will be to choose the right unit
> * Accounts-in-a-tree, that sounds interesting :) I was already planning to give one "account" the ability to hold more than one address so returns can be kept together
> * This one is not going to get easy since I'm using Qt net libs. The core component do not use QtGui so it can be easily connected to a gtk UI, but the networking will still be done by Qt
> * The client itself will not include any generator, generation will be handled by external binaries via a specific API. Still I'll include a CPU miner in the distro, giving it the ability to generate at lower speeds should be possible (result may vary depending on OS)
> * This one is already planned in the UI :p

> * SI denominations are already a standard. So you don't need to pick a unit.
> * Maybe you could have 2 components- core network with API as a library, and thin client GUI on top.
> * Not including a generator in the application is a *great idea*.

Another idea. The main list view should look something like this:



|style="background-color:#ff9999;"Processing (2)|style="background-color:#ff9999;"20 Dec 10|style="background-color:#ff9999;"hello jon|style="background-color:#ff9999;"-10|style="background-color:#ff9999;"170
|style="background-color:#99ff99;"Confirmed (10)|style="background-color:#99ff99;"18 Dec 10|style="background-color:#99ff99;"bls djdsksd sdls|style="background-color:#99ff99;"+20|style="background-color:#99ff99;"180


The date should be in that format, as it's confusing for non-Americans as they write the date wrong as MM/DD/YY instead of the usual DD/MM/YY.

Also here's a link to a list of [SI prefixes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SI_prefix). People find it confusing dealing with large numbers, which is why SI prefixes exist. It's easier to handle numbers in the 0-100 range than the 10000000000-100000000000 range.

Another idea would be that it'd be nice to associate bitcoin addresses with people's names like with email. So if I wanted to send money to my friend John, then I just click his name. [Genjix](User:Genjix) 17:35, 24 December 2010 (GMT)
