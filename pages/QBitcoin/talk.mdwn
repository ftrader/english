## Skip IRC bootstrap?

As [said in the earlier stages of bitcoin](http://www.bitcoin.org/smf/index.php?topic=84.0) IRC is only a temporary solution for bootstrapping. Since I do not feel like implementing something that will be dropped soon after, I'd guess I should just skip the IRC bootstrap part and implement various other way to harvest initial nodes. I'm thinking of storing known peers in a database, and keeping those that stay most of the time (ie, got a fixed ip and provide bitcoin service). Any comment?
