All traders are listed in order of price (GBP) with the cheapest first. Traders who are willing to deal with new customers (i.e. no previous trades or reputation required) are indicated with a small orange tick next to the their name.

Each trader is also given a reputation rating (0-100). For traders on BitBargain the rating is taken from BitBargain's own BitRating system and for LocalBitcoins the rating is taken from their own Feedback score system. For the other sites Bittylicious, QuickBitcoin, Speedy Bitcoin and Bitcoin123 the rating is taken from the TrustScore provided by [Trustpilot](http://www.trustpilot.co.uk).

Other trader information such as the payment type accepted and the minimum/maximum BTC which is available for sale or to be bought is also displayed.
