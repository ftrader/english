*BittyBot* compares the UK BItcoin Market to help you find the best sellers and the best prices.

### Website

The site is updated every 5 minutes to show all of the online P2P sellers from the UK's most popular Bitcoin marketplaces:

* [[BitBargain|BitBargain]]
* [[Bittylicious|Bittylicious]]
* [[LocalBitcoins|LocalBitcoins]]
* [[QuickBitcoin|Quickbitcoin]]

All the sellers are sorted by price so you can easily see who is currently offering the best price in the UK. Seller's who are willing to sell to newbie customers (i.e. no previous trades or reputation required) are also indicated with a small orange tick next to the sellers name.

As seller reputation is very important we show a Rating for each seller. For BitBargain and LocalBitcoins we are using their sites respective BitRating or Feedback scores. For Bittylicious and QuickBitcoin we get the Rating from the TrustScore via [Trustpilot](http://www.trustpilot.co.uk).

For each seller we also display the Payment Type accepted along with the Price per Bitcoin and the Minimum/Maximum BTC which is available for sale. If you hover the cursor over the sellers price it will indicate the percentage spread compared to the current [[CoinDesk BPI|Coindesk#CoinDesk_Bitcoin_Price_Index]].

All of this aggregated seller information can be re-sorted, and searched directly from within your browser. A complete list of all online sellers is available [here](http://bittybot.co.uk/uk-bitcoin-sellers/).

### Twitter

As well as the BittyBot website you can also follow [@Bitty_Bot](https://twitter.com/bitty_bot) on Twitter to keep uptodate with the best prices available.
