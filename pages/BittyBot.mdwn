BittyBot compares the UK Bitcoin Market.

### Website

The site is updated every 5 minutes to show all of the online P2P sellers from the following UK Bitcoin marketplaces:

* [[BitBargain|BitBargain]]
* [[Bittylicious|Bittylicious]]
* [[LocalBitcoins|LocalBitcoins]]
* [[QuickBitcoin|Quickbitcoin]]
* Speedy Bitcoin

All sellers are listed in order of price (GBP) with the cheapest first. Seller's who are willing to sell to new customers (i.e. no previous trades or reputation required) are indicated with a small orange tick next to the sellers name.

Each seller is also given a reputation rating (0-100). For sellers on BitBargain the rating is taken from BitBargain's own BitRating system and for LocalBitcoins the rating is taken from their own Feedback score system. For the other sites Bittylicious, QuickBitcoin and Speedy Bitcoin the rating is taken from the TrustScore provided by [Trustpilot](http://www.trustpilot.co.uk).

Other seller information such as the payment type accepted and the minimum/maximum BTC which is available for sale is also displayed. It is possible to hover over a sellers price to see the percentage margin compared to the current [[CoinDesk BPI|Coindesk#CoinDesk_Bitcoin_Price_Index]] price.

All of this aggregated seller information can be re-sorted, and searched directly from within the web browser. A complete list of all online sellers is available [here](http://bittybot.co.uk/uk-bitcoin-sellers/).
