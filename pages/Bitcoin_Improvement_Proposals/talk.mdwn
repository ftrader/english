There are additional BIPs here in the Wiki but not on this article.  The [[BIP category|tags/BIP]] lists some of them. [[!template id=unsigned Sgornick 18:09, 15 April 2012â€Ž]]

## Adding BIPs going forward

While I think it's good to have a page explaining what BIPs are and a list of the BIPs on the wiki, perhaps it's best if individual BIPs are no longer added here - linking instead to the official entry for the BIP externally.  I have added BIP67 to the list and made just such a link, rather than adding another stub.  If anybody disagrees, they're welcome to add the stub as well, but perhaps there should be some discussion on this.
