There are additional BIPs here in the Wiki but not on this article.  The [[BIP category|tags/BIP]] lists some of them. [[!template id=unsigned Sgornick 18:09, 15 April 2012â€Ž]]

## Adding BIPs going forward

While I think it's good to have a page explaining what BIPs are and a list of the BIPs on the wiki, perhaps it's best if individual BIPs are no longer added here - linking instead to the official entry for the BIP externally.  I have added BIP67 to the list and made just such a link, rather than adding another stub.  If anybody disagrees, they're welcome to add the stub as well, but perhaps there should be some discussion on this.

>  Since the individual BIPs are changing constantly it'd be near impossible to keep each page updated successfully. The template is already in place to link to the github pages. We could keep updating the table just linking to the Github instead of the wiki pages. I think it's a good idea, Steve.
