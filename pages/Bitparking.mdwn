A merge mining pool that allows mining bitcoins (BTC), [[Namecoin]] (NMC), ixcoin (IXC) and [[Devcoin]] (DVC). The pool originally started out as a PPS pool around January 28th 2012 but switched to the Double Geometric Method on May 1st, 2013  (1.1) for bitcoin rewards. The merge mined coins kept the PPS payment method.

##Reward distribution

* 1.5% fee with Double geometric method  (2.1) for bitcoin rewards.
* 2.5% fee with PPS method for merged mining rewards of [[Namecoin]], [[Devcoin]] and ixcoin.
* Pays for orphan blocks
* Payout available as soon as a block is found for bitcoin and immediately a share is submitted for the merge mined coins. No waiting for 120 confirmations.

##Extra Features

* Stratum support with merge mining
* IRC channel #mmpool on the freenode network

##History

The Bitparking range of pools and exchanges originated when the operator started one of the first public bitcoin mining pools in October 2010  (4.1). After that pool was closed Bitparking opened as a BTC/NMC exchange on June 03, 2011 (4.2) and followed with a Namecoin mining pool. Over the Bitparking's history it has operated exchanges and pools for ixcoin, i0coin, ppcoin, and others but they have since closed.
