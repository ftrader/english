The **testnet** is an alternative Bitcoin [[block_chain]], to be used for testing. This allows application developers or bitcoin testers to experiment, without having to use real bitcoins or worrying about breaking the main bitcoin chain.

##Differences

* Instead of ports 8333 (listen) and 8332 (JSON-RPC), ports 18333 and 18332 are used.
* Bootstrapping IRC channel is #bitcoinTEST instead of #bitcoin (both on irc.lfnet.org). The built-in node list is disabled.
* A different value of ADDRESSVERSION field ensures no testnet BitCoin addresses will work on the production network. (0xff rather than 0x00)
* The protocol message header bytes are shifted up (0xFABFB5DA instead of 0xF9BEB4D9)
* Minimum [[difficulty]] of 1.0 on testnet is equal to difficulty of 0.5 on mainnet. This means that the mainnet-equivalent of any testnet difficulty is half the testnet difficulty.
