**Bitcoin Standards Organization** is a virtual organization with a mission to develop and recommend open standards and implement open source reference implementations to improve interoperability among systems that enable Bitcoin Enterprises to provide products and services to Bitcoin users.

Open standards and open source reference implementations are expected to make Bitcoin Enterprises more efficient and thus more competitive compared to companies that use non-virtual currencies, patents, and proprietary formats, protocols and Application Programming Interfaces. When an open standard and an open source reference implementation is developed, then every Bitcoin Enterprise that choose to utilize them will benefit as well as their users and customers.
