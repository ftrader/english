The "nonce" in a bitcoin [[block]] is a 32-bit (4-byte) field whose value is set so that the [[hash]] of the block will contain a run of zeros. The rest of the fields may not be changed, as they have a defined meaning.

Any change to the block data (such as the nonce) will make the block hash completely different. Since it is [believed infeasible](wikipedia:Cryptographic hash function) to predict which combination of bits will result in the right hash, many different nonce values are tried, and the hash is recomputed for each value until a hash containing the required number of zero bits is found. As this iterative calculation requires time and resources, the presentation of the block with the correct nonce value constitutes [[proof_of_work]].

## Golden Nonce
A *golden nonce* in Bitcoin [[mining]] is a nonce which results in a [[hash|block_hashing_algorithm]] value lower than the target [[difficulty]].  
In many practical mining applications, this is simplified to any nonce which has 32 leading zeroes (2.1), with a secondary test checking if the actual value is lower than the target difficulty.

### Etymology
The term *golden nonce* most likely evolved from the term *[golden ticket](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_and_the_Chocolate_Factory#Plot)* as used to refer to a nonce satisfying the mining requirements as early as April 8th, 2011 (3.1)
