# User manual
## TP LINK WR703N
The USB on the AR9331 has bugs. If you want use serial console, please use the direct serial console on 703N (the **/dev/ttyATH0**). It's far more stable than USB-serial converter. You may want add a USB hub between machine and 703n

## Raspberry Pi
   [[!img "13_ports_usb_hub.png" title="320px " title="thumb " title="The 13 ports USB HUB "]]

* The default firmware IP address is **192.168.0.100**, you can access it by http://192.168.0.100
* You may need update the address/DNS to your local configuration. DO NOT FORGET your IP address.
* If the Raspberry Pi can access internet, cgminer should automatic start

* 8GB Memory card: http://item.jd.com/632744.html
* Reflash: sudo dd if=openwrt-brcm2708-sdcard-vfat-ext4.img of=/dev/sdb bs=4M #/dev/sdb is your memory card

## Overclock

* Chip Freq: 1700, Voltage: 10750 --> 119GHs
	Extra cooling is recommended, GJPMiningco recommends removing the slide panel that covers the heatsink and adding some fans that blow down into the heatsink - at least 3 fans evenly spaced along the heatsink.

# Firmware

## [http://downloads.canaan-creative.com/software/avalon2/2014-05-26 20140526]

* Update to OpenWrt r40859, Update cgminer to 4.3.3
* Add option: **--avalon2-cutoff** <arg> Set Avalon2 overheat cut off temperature (default: 88)
* Add option: **--avalon2-fixed-speed** Set Avalon2 fan to fixed speed
* Update default modulars from **3 to 4**
* Only display the module that attached
* Ignore frequent stratum message. make MM have more time to hashing

## [http://downloads.canaan-creative.com/software/avalon2/NEXT-TESTING/ NEXT-TESTING]

* NOTICE: Only for testing

# Test plan

* New firmware don't break Avalon for sure
* New firmware don't use all flash. have to keep some space for save configuration
* Either and WiFi(703N) connect works fine
* Cgminer works fine(the kernel user driver, cgminer it self, cgminer-monitor and uci configurations files)
* After configure cgminer. [& Apply](Save) can restart the cgminer
* The Status/API log page works fine
* Test mining. the hashrate should be correct
* Test the cgminer-monitor. make sure it can restart cgminer
* When network was down poweroff ASIC
* Automatic fan adjustment
* Make sure 80/22/4028 open on WAN.
* Test 10 avalon2 single module with one host (703N or RPi)

# Testing on ASIC cores

* The Avalon2/3 MM firmware support testing out of box. no needs particular firmware.
* The host test program is here: https://github.com/BitSyncom/avalon-extras/blob/master/scripts/avalon-mm-modular-test.py
* Please check the code for help
