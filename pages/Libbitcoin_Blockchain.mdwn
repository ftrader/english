The [libbitcoin-blockchain](https://github.com/libbitcoin/libbitcoin-blockchain) library is a dependency of [[libbitcoin-node|Libbitcoin_Node]] and [[libbitcoin-server|Libbitcoin_Server]]. It was originally contained within [[libbitcoin|Libbitcoin_Common]].

##Consensus Validation
By default the library depends on the [[libbitcoin-consensus|Libbitcoin_Consensus]] library. This ensures that consensus checks are identical to those implemented by [[bitcoind|Bitcoind]]. By building using the *--without-consensus* flag the dependency is avoided and [[libbitcoin|Libbitcoin]] native consensus checks are used instead.
