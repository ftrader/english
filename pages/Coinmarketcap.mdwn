**Coinmarketcap** is a website for tracking capitalization of various cryptocurrencies.

## Summary

The page provides various data about several listed coins, such as their price, available supply, trade volume over last 24 hours or market capitalization.

The statistics are updated every 5 minutes. Market capitalization is calculated by multiplying price by total supply. Prices are calculated by averaging the prices at the major exchanges weighted by volume.

Coins with stale datapoints (more than 6 hours old) are shown at the bottom of the list with question marks, and are de-listed after 7 days.

## Addition of the new coins

For a coin to be added it must meet following criteria:

* It must be a cryptocurrency
* It must be traded on a public exchange that is older than 30 days and with an API available.
* It must have a public URL that displays the total supply (total coins mined so far).
