A coast-to-coast journey where no dollars are being spent, only bitcoins.  The trip was made by Bitcoin community member Plato between April 2011 and June 2011.

The plans for the trip were communicated on March 21, 2011 which described the motivation and the method for traveling from Hartford to L.A. spending no dollars for expenses or other purchases (1.1).

The trip is being blogged and tweeted.  Tweets use the hashtag #BItcoinRoadTrip.

While on the leg of the trip through Alabama, Plato's trip was put on hold to assist with the cleanup following the tornadoes that occurred close by to Plato.  Plato made a plea for donations from the Bitcoin community and funds were received were then donated to a tornado victim from a trailer park (1.2).

On May 25th Plato was interviewed on the Corbett Report (1.3).

Plato arrived in Los Angeles on June 13th 2011. The first thing he purchased with US Dollars was a broccoli cheddar breadbowl at Panera in Venice Beach.
