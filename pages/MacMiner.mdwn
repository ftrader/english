MacMiner is the first native Mac Bitcoin, Litecoin and Alt coin mining software for Mac OS X and the only native open source GUI app that lets you compile it yourself, so you can check every line of code. MacMiner is written in Objective-C and the backends are coded in C/C++.

Included are compiled versions of bfgminer, cgminer and cpuminer (minerd)
