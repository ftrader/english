<span style="color:blue;font-size:1.25em">==How does it work?==</span>


All of this may seem super complicated, so let’s get down to the meat and bone of it. BitMixer has a huge reserve of Bitcoins already in its system. A user sends us their BTC and we cap it onto the end of our reserve chain. We then pay the amount of what was purchased from the beginning of our reserve.

This method of mixing means that you do not have to wait for other customers – coins already mixed are instantly available.
