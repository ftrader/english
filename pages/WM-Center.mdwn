WM-Center is one of the leading e-currency exchangers.

##History

After [regulatory actions](http://www.coindesk.com/wm-center-e-currency-exchange-seized-by-us-government) connected to Liberty Reserve shutdown were taken by the U.S. government, wm-center.com domain was seized (because this exchange service was presented in the exchangers section of Liberty Reserve site). The service continued to work using wm-center.es and wm-center.ru domains for a while.
