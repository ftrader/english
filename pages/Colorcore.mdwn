[Colorcore](https://github.com/OpenAssets/colorcore) is an open source colored coin wallet compatible the [[Open Assets protocol|Colored_Coins#Open_Assets]] and [[Coinprism]]. 
##Colored Coins


##Specifications


##Features

* **Issue you own coins**
Anybody can issue their own coins. It only takes a single Bitcoin transaction. The only fee you have to pay is the Bitcoin transaction fee (which can be zero), which makes Colorcore much more efficient than alternatives like XCP (about $20 to issue an asset).
Also, you don't need to buy any intermediary coin (like XCP) since colored coins work directly on top of Bitcoin.

* **Send and receive assets**
Use your address to receive assets from other people. You can also send assets, again for the price of a standard Bitcoin transaction.

* **Manage crowdfunding campaigns**
Finally a way to manage a truly decentralized crowdfuding campaign. You don't have to trust a complex and limited exchange protocol, the "distribute" feature creates standard Bitcoin transactions. There is no magic behind it.

Every asset created or exchanged using Colorcore are visible on the  [[Coinprism.info block explorer|Coinprism.info]], and can be sent to a [[Coinprism]] web-wallet.

##Installation and dependencies
Colorcore does not connect to any external service. All it needs is access to the Bitcoin blockchain, via Bitcoin Core. Therefore in order to run Colorcore, you need Bitcoin Core running with RPC enabled and the -txindex=1 -server=1 flags.

Follow these instructions to install Colorcore:

* Windows users: make sure you have Python 3 and pip installed on your machine
* Run the following commands:

<code>git clone https://github.com/OpenAssets/colorcore.git
cd colorcore
pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt
</code><br />

* Edit the config.ini file with the username, password and port for your local Bitcoin Core instance (rpcurl setting).

You are now ready to run Colorcore.

##How to use Colorcore?

* **Get your balance**<br/>
Run the following command to get your balance:<br/>
<code>  python colorcore.py getbalance</code><br/>
[[!img "Colorcore_1.png‎‎" size=400x400]]<br/>
All the addresses with a non-zero balance on your Bitcoin Core wallet will be displayed. The 'assets' field will show how much assets you have. If you don't have any asset, it will be empty. Each asset has a 'assetAddress' field as well as a 'quantity' field. 'assetAddress' is what identifies the asset. It is cryptographically secure, and it is impossible for two people to be owner of the same asset address. 'quantity' is an integer indicating how many units of that asset you own.<br/>

* **Create your own asset**<br />
First, you need to create an address in Bitcoin Core. This address will represent your asset, and the private key associated will be required for any issuance of the asset. Note that the protocol supports multi-sig addresses for issuance, though that is not implemented in Colorcore 1.0.
Run the following command on bitcoind (not Colorcore):<br/>
<code>  bitcoind getnewaddress</code><br />
This will generate a private key and return the address. Make sure your wallet.dat file is properly backed up.
Now transfer a small amount of bitcoins (0.0002 BTC is enough) to that newly created address.
Run the following command to issue one million colored coins:<br/>
<code>  python colorcore.py issueasset <address> 1000000</code><br/>
You can issue up to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807 colored coins at once. Unlike older colored coins implementations, you only need 0.000006 BTC for issuing coins, regardless of the quantity you want to issue.
This command will return a transaction hash. You can look up that transaction hash on the coinprism.info block explorer.

* **How do I give my asset a name?**<br />
Of course, this is not very useful if you can't identify what asset is what. In order to link information such as a name to your coin, you need to create a metadata file, and host it on your web server. Of course, this doesn't introduce centralization since you are already the issuer of the coin, and the value of your coin (if any) already comes from you. Since you are responsible for the value of the coin you are issuing, it is not an issue if you also host the information about this coin. The metadata file is a JSON file and contains the following information:
<br />
<code>
  {"source_addresses": [
    "source address for the coin (can be obtained from the getbalance call)"
  ],
  "contract_url": "https://yoursite.com/more-info-about-the-coin",
  "name_short": "ICECC",
  "name": "The Ice Cream Coin",
  "issuer": "Vanilla Inc",
  "description": "This coin is worth an ice cream at any Vanilla Inc shop.",
  "description_mime": "text/x-markdown; charset=UTF-8",
  "type": "Points",
  "divisibility": 0,
  "link_to_website": true,
  "icon_url": "https://yoursite.com/coin-icon.jpg",
  "image_url": "https://yoursite.com/coin-image.jpg",
  "version": "1.0"}
</code>
The assuming you have placed that file at: https://yoursite.com/icecream, use the following argument when issuing the coins:
<code>  python colorcore.py issueasset <address> 1000000 --metadata u=https://yoursite.com/icecream</code><br />
You can then lookup the color address on coinprism.info, and you should see all that information.
<br />
Only the URL (https://yoursite.com/icecream) is stored on the Blockchain.
