##Colored Coins


##Specifications


##Features

* Issue you own coins
Anybody can issue their own coins. It only takes a single Bitcoin transaction. The only fee you have to pay is the Bitcoin transaction fee (which can be zero), which makes Colorcore much more efficient than alternatives like XCP (about $20 to issue an asset).
Also, you don't need to buy any intermediary coin (like XCP) since colored coins work directly on top of Bitcoin.

* Send and receive assets
Use your address to receive assets from other people. You can also send assets, again for the price of a standard Bitcoin transaction.

* Manage crowdfunding campaigns
Finally a way to manage a truly decentralized crowdfuding campaign. You don't have to trust a complex and limited exchange protocol, the "distribute" feature creates standard Bitcoin transactions. There is no magic behind it.
