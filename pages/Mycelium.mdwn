In case the phone is lost and no replacement readily available, the wallet can be recovered using [these instructions](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=909238.msg10003275#msg10003275).

##Local Trader

Mycelium Local Trader is a decentralized in-person exchange that is built right into the Mycelium bitcoin wallet. Because the coins are stored locally in your wallet, the Local Trader exchange never needs to hold any of your bitcoins or fiat. Local Trader servers only help arrange the trade between buyers and sellers, manage the transaction, and calculate reputation ratings based on the trades.

##Bitcoincard

Bitcoincard is a stand-alone device that acts as an electronic wallet. It can be used to secure the wallet in a safe place (outside the computer, making it inaccessible to hackers). The goal is to create an infrastructure-independent, self-powered, ad-hoc network that could dynamically form wherever a sufficient number of nodes came together to support it. A prototype was presented in Q1 2015. (4.1)

##Mycelium Entropy

Mycelium Entropy is a small USB device that uses hardware based entropy to generate directly printable Bitcoin paper wallets, without the need for a PC.  The project was successfully funded on Indiegogo (5.1).

##Mycelium Gear

Mycelium Gear is designed to allow you to receive BTC from customers directly into your wallet controlled by you only. Mycelium Gear eliminates the notion of payouts - you get your BTC instantly. It's easy to integrate with your online store or website, with no special skills required. Optionally you can convert your BTC to fiat using the [[Cashila]] service. 

##History

The Mycelium project was announced 13. September 2013 (7.1). The project was formerly called [[BitcoinSpinner]]. Since 7. October 2014 the wallet supports the  [[hierarchical deterministic (HD)|Deterministic_wallet]] (7.2) system. On 18. December 2014 the iOS version was announced (7.3).
