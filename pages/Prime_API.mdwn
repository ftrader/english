Prime API is based on JSON, delivered through HTTPS and is mostly REST-ful.

##Public API

Public API calls are available without authentication.

##Private API

Private API calls require authentication via:

* Your personal API key and optionally
* IP address

Private API is **off by default**. You need to enable it in your profile.
