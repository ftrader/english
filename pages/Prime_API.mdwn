##Introduction

Prime API is based on JSON, delivered through HTTPS and is mostly REST-ful.

API URIs always start with a marker "/v1" to make the version explicit.

All timestamps are returned in ISO 8601 format:

	YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ

##Public API

Public API calls are available without authentication.

##Private API

Private API calls require authentication via:

* Your personal API key and optionally
* IP address

Private API is **off by default**. You need to enable it in your profile.

You are expected to **pass the API key as a HTTP header**:
	Authorization: PrimeExchange 84ffsOscok1Asbbqj28gcscv86M3nj4bRIamFaKe
...where the long string is of course your API key.

It is also possible to pass the API key as a request param:
	?api_key=84ffsOscok1Asbbqj28gcscv86M3nj4bRIamFaKe
...although this is not recommended as sensitive data should not be passed in the URI.
