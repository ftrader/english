For the Bitcoin business, see [[Coinbase_(business)]].

The **coinbase** is the content of the 'input' of a generation transaction. While regular transactions use the 'inputs' section to refer to their parent transaction outputs, a generation transaction has no parent, and creates new coins from nothing. 

The coinbase can contain any arbitrary data. The [[genesis_block]] famously contains the dated title of an FT article:
	The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks
