## How To Pluralize Satoshi (Unit)

In [[User:Theymos]]'s recent edit of the [[FAQ]], he says: "The plural of satoshi is satoshi: 'Send me 100 satoshi'."  I'm not sure how common this irregular plural form is.  The regular form does seem to be at least somewhat common:

* http://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/114/what-is-a-satoshi
* https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=14438.20
* More: https://www.google.com/?gws_rd=ssl#q=%22satoshis%22

I was wondering whether anyone has strong evidence for prefering one form over the other so we can update the FAQ and this page accordingly.  (Mainly, I'm interested because I help maintain the Bitcoin.org developer documentation which makes extensive use of the regular plural form, and I want to know whether we should switch to the irregular plural form.) --[Harding](User:Harding) ([[talk|User_talk:Harding]]) 19:22, 6 December 2014 (UTC)
> Came here from the [[Units]] page which uses the form 'satoshis'.  Decided to do a completely unscientific study with Google, using the search phrase 'bitcoin "x satoshi"' and 'bitcoin "x satoshis"' where x was the numbers 2-10, 25, 50, 100, 500, 1,000, 10,000, 100,000, 1,000,000 and 100,000,000 as well as their written form.  All in all, for numerical writing, *Satoshi* beat out *Satoshis* 4:1.  For written form, *Satoshi* beat out 'Satoshis* 1.23:1.
> There are some notable exceptions.  'Two' sees far many more 'Satoshis' than 'Satoshi'.  This may be a result of "just my two satoshis" akin to "my two cents".  'Hundred million' (the number of Satoshi(s) per Bitcoin) sees vastly more counts of 'Satoshis' than it does 'Satoshi'.
