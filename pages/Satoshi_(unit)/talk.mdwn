## How To Pluralize Satoshi (Unit)

In [[User:Theymos]]'s recent edit of the [[FAQ]], he says: "The plural of satoshi is satoshi: 'Send me 100 satoshi'."  I'm not sure how common this irregular plural form is.  The regular form does seem to be at least somewhat common:

* http://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/114/what-is-a-satoshi
* https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=14438.20
* More: https://www.google.com/?gws_rd=ssl#q=%22satoshis%22

I was wondering whether anyone has strong evidence for prefering one form over the other so we can update the FAQ and this page accordingly.  (Mainly, I'm interested because I help maintain the Bitcoin.org developer documentation which makes extensive use of the regular plural form, and I want to know whether we should switch to the irregular plural form.) --[Harding](User:Harding) ([[talk|User_talk:Harding]]) 19:22, 6 December 2014 (UTC)
