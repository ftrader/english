Also, consider using SI prefixes. They are standard throughout the world (except America). [Genjix](User:Genjix) 08:04, 10 January 2011 (GMT)

* SI/decimal is the inferior competition/enemy of the superior Tonal system. That is, to be avoided. (Chinese is a standard language throughout most of the world too! And whatever the currency of China is-- should we not use bitcoins??) [Luke-jr](User:Luke-jr) 15:05, 10 January 2011 (GMT)

Can someone fix the name of the page? It's "Scheme", not "Schema". [Luke-jr](User:Luke-jr) 15:35, 10 January 2011 (GMT)
>  maybe even "URI scheme" to be more precise? since there can be many differenct schemes about stuff. :) --[Nanotube](User:Nanotube) 05:48, 12 January 2011 (GMT)

##### Numerical Syntax

* Wouldn't it be better if we used the more standard "e" to represent the exponent? e.g. 5e8 = 500,000,000. - [Weavejester](User:Weavejester) 11:18 PM, 18 April 2011 (GMT)

* On a similar note, it's more standard to use a "0x" prefix to denote hexadecimal numbers, e.g. 0xf00. - [Weavejester](User:Weavejester) 11:29 PM, 18 April 2011 (GMT)

##### Fallback URI
On Android an app can register to open with a normal web URI.  This has the advantage of acting as a fallback URI in case there is no app that supports **bitcoin:**.  For example we could propose **<nowiki>https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Send/<address>[?][amount=<size>][&][label=<label>][&][message=<message>]</nowiki>**.  If the user had a mobile app that supported bitcoin it would have registered **<nowiki>https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Send/</nowiki>** and be launched.  If the user did not have such an app their browser would launch and be directed to **https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Send/**.  This page could then inform the user about various apps that support bitcoin transfers and possibly have a link to [[MyBitcoin]] as well.  Maybe **https://bitcoin.org/Send/** would be more appropriate, though that one might not be updated often enough.

* iPhone support
There is even a way to have this work on iOS devices.  Have the web page redirect to the standard **bitcoin:** scheme.  If an app is present to support this the app will launch, if not the browser the will stay open at the explanation page.

* Upshot
This fallback proposal will make bitcoin QR codes meaningful regardless of if the user has a bitcoin app installed.--[BitMark](User:BitMark) 16:05, 2 April 2011 (GMT)

## Use-cases - buy this link
On the buy-this link, perhaps we should also incorporate an optional transaction id or something which would be passed along to the bitcoin client. Not really transaction but some sort of arbitrary data, only meaningful to the merchant. Something an online merchant can use to verify which transaction it has received is relevant to a purchase.
