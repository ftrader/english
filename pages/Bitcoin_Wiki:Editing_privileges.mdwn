Before you can begin editing, you must **activate your wiki account**.

To activate your account, you can pick one of these methods:

* Post your wiki username on [this](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1025908.0) BitcoinTalk thread
* Enter [this](https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=bitcoin-wiki&uio=d4) IRC channel and ask directly

We ask that you do this to prove that you are not an evil robot.
