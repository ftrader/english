Bitino.com is a fun and provably fair Hi/Lo Card Game for Bitcoin.

## GamePlay 
The purpose of the Hi/Lo is to predict whether the next card drawn will be higher or lower than the current card. Cards are drawn using Python's Randint function. You can continue playing until you withdraw or guess wrongly.

## Provably Fair Gaming 
Bitino offers Provably Fair Gaming. This means anyone can immediately and independently verify we have no control over the ordering of the cards and the game cannot be tampered with.

To achieve Provably Fair Gaming we utiilise powerful cryptographic algorithms. These ensure neither you nor us can possibly know the shuffle of a deck until the moment a game begins and any retroactive manipulation would be impossible to hide. Our random numbers are generated using Python's implementation of the Mersenne Twister / Fisher Yates Shuffle.
