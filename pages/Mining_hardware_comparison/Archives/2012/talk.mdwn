## Wrong Data 7850

I thinkt the data for the ATI 7850 single gpu is wrong.
Should I just change it?
I got an 7850 OC (overclocked) and get this data

## Don't add traps like $/day figures

Stuff like $/day encourages unsound reasoning by people who don't know better. It seems likely now that the difficulty is about to go up a bunch, and even if it doesn't the reward is going to halve before anything pays itself off.  Likewise don't list price and performance for speculative, unreleased products that could just be scams, or may not live up to specs or be available for many months. --[Gmaxwell](User:Gmaxwell) ([[talk|User_talk:Gmaxwell]]) 01:37, 15 September 2012 (GMT)
