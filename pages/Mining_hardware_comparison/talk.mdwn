## Achilles Labs line-up

I have removed the Achilles Labs line-up of miners.  This was previously also done by Jimmothy, resulting in a minor revert edit war with Vip3r.  Currently their website still displays little more than a render, little details on what's supposedly inside, and only accepts payment in Bitcoin.

While Vip3r claims that the units are actually shipping, no evidence thereof has been presented or even found.  The only semi-reference I have found is at: https://2ch.hk/cc/res/84695.html  
Supposedly that page shows Achilles Labs units in a mine, but that mine itself has none of the hallmarks of an actual mine, and more of warehousing - which may very well be empty cases.

Until such a time as that more information is presented or found in the wild, I recommend that the Achilles Labs line-up of products remains removed from the listing.

This wiki editing war seems a bit silly so let's resolve this. Please contact us at sales@achilleslabs.com stating what information you wish to obtain. I believe we'll work something out.

## Pre-orders

Listing of hardware that can only be pre-ordered should be discouraged.  Listing of vaporware should be disallowed.  In either of these cases, if you have editing capabilities, consider removing the listing.  While everyone should do their due diligence before making a purchase - especially in pre-order cases - we can all help to keep things a bit more tidy by only having a comparison of actual, existing hardware that ships now or has shipped in the past.

If there is disagreement on the above, perhaps we can agree to have a separate section for pre-orders and vaporware, which could then carry an additional warning. Open for discussion :) [TheRealSteve](User:TheRealSteve) ([[talk|User_talk:TheRealSteve]]) 14:33, 7 February 2015 (UTC)
