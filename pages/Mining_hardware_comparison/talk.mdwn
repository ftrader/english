Question about mega-hashes per Watt versus mega-hashes per Joule. Does anyone have an opinion? Most people know what a Watt is but I think seeing MHash/J could be confusing to some people. While perhaps being more accurate, using "/J" might go over some people's heads, especially since the edit was given with little to no explanation. [Vast](User:Vast) 06:45, 19 April 2011 (GMT)

Is the note about the AMD Stream SDK valid anymore? Looking down the list it seems people are doing just as well and sometimes better on the 2.3 and 2.4 SDK as compared to the 2.1. [Tybeet](User:Tybeet) 23:04, 5 May 2011 (GMT)

## Color Coding

What is the color coding indicative of?

## Power Calculation

How do people calculate power?  I took the [idle power numbers from Tom's Hardware](http://www.tomshardware.com/charts/2011-gaming-graphics-charts/2D-Power-Draw,2677.html), then measured incremental power w/a Kill-A-Watt when hashing on my ATI 6970 (its the one w/1.96 Mhashes/W).

## OS Listing

Think extracting out an OS column would be useful? Possibly OS version or architecture as well.

## Cheapest card per mhash/s ?
i'll pick ... the 5830 --[Compn](User:Compn) 16:51, 3 June 2011 (GMT)
