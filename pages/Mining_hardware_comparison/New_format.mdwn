[[!template id=seealso Non-specialized hardware comparison]]
Below are some statistics about the mining performance of various hardware used in a Bitcoin [[mining_rig]]. For GPUs, CPUs, and other hardware not specifically designed for bitcoin mining [[see here|Non-specialized_hardware_comparison]]. **Only specialized equipment that has been shipped will appear in this list.**

**Notes:** 

* Mhash/s = millions of [[hashes per second|hash_per_second]] ([[double sha256|Protocol_specification#Hashes]] raw speed performance; may not be very energy efficient with some models)
* Mhash/J = millions of hashes per joule (energy efficiency; 1 joule of energy is 1 watt during 1 second: 1 J = 1 W*s)
* W = watt (maximum power consumption, i.e. energy per unit of time: 1 W = 1 J/s)

**Be sure to research any of these vendors and machines intensely before spending any money.**
