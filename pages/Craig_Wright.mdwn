Craig Wright is an Australian Bitcoin enthusiast. On December 9 2015 articles in Wired (1.1) and Gizmodo (1.2) pointed to him as a possible candidate for the identity of [[Satoshi_Nakamoto]].

These claims, despite being echoed by media worldwide, are very quickly collecting evidence to the contrary. On December 12th Wired (1.3) published a new article suggesting that the weight of the evidence is against Wright being Satoshi.
