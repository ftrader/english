Craig Wright is an Australian Bitcoin enthusiast. On December 9 2015 articles in Wired (1.1) and Gizmodo (1.2) pointed to him as a possible candidate for the identity of [[Satoshi_Nakamoto]].

Despite being echoed by media worldwide, there is an increasing body of evidence contradicting this claim. On December 12th Wired (1.3) published a new article suggesting that the weight of the evidence is against Wright being Satoshi.

On April 1st 2016 the FT published a story titled "Craig Wrightâ€™s upcoming big reveal" (1.4) hinting at his soon-to-come outing as Satoshi. Some sources ignored the date, setting off the rumour mill again (1.5). 

On 2 May 2016, Craig Wright's blog publicly claimed that he was in fact Satoshi Nakamoto. In articles released on the same day, journalists from the BBC and *The Economist* stated that they witnessed Wright digitally signing a message using the private key associated with the first bitcoin transaction. (1.6) (1.7) Both [[Jon_Matonis]] and [[Gavin_Andresen]] supported Wright's claim based on in-person signing demonstrations they witnessed. (1.8)

However, [[Peter_Todd]] said that the evidence provided by Wright's blog post, which appeared to contain cryptographic proof, actually contained no proof at all. (1.9) The [[Bitcoin_Core]] project released a statement on Twitter saying "There is currently no publicly available cryptographic proof that anyone in particular is Bitcoin's creator." (1.10) (1.11) [[Jeff_Garzik]] agreed that evidence publicly provided by Wright was insufficient, and security researcher Dan Kaminsky concluded Wright's claim was "intentional scammery". (1.12) (1.13)

On May 4, another post on Wright's blog promised "a series of pieces that will lay the foundations for this extraordinary claim". (1.14) (1.15) But the following day, he deleted all his blog posts and replaced them with a notice entitled "I'm Sorry", which read in part:

But, as the events of this week unfolded and I prepared to publish the proof of access to the earliest keys, I broke. I do not have the courage.
