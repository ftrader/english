Trades can be done via a web interface, or by using the API. Open-source automated trading software written in Python and JavaScript is provided [on GitHub](https://github.com/bitfloor).

###Fees
Market orders, that execute immediately, incur a 0.4% fee. Orders that don't execute immediately receive a 0.1% rebate, to encourage liquidity providers to offer information about their market expectations.

##Features
The exchange offers automated trading capabilities via a simple REST API, and via a FIX ([Financial Information eXchange](Wikipedia:Financial_Information_eXchange)) order entry gateway. (10.1).

##Anonymity
Bitfloor allows access through Tor and does not require any personally identifiable information until the user wishes to withdraw money using ACH. Deposits can be made via [[LocalTill]] -> Bank of America, by depositing cash. No ID or personal information is required, and bank tellers do not ask for the reason the deposit is made.

##History

The exchange had been operating since 2011 with its first publicity occurring in February 2012 (12.1).

On September 4, 2012 the operator of BitFloor reported a security breach that resulted in the exchange's wallet with **24K BTC being stolen**.  The site was shuttered and access to customer funds denied as the exchange's reserves were insufficient to accommodate all funds deposited.  As of March 8, 2013, 3 months had passed since the last repayment (December 2012), and the operator had been unresponsive. (12.2)

On April 3, 2012, the website was down for several minutes. (12.3)

BitFloor became a Money Service Business (MSB) registered with FinCEN (#31000005224108) on March 15, 2012. (12.4)
