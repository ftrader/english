The exchange had been operating since 2011 with its first publicity occurring in February 2012 (10.1).

On September 4, 2012 the operator of BitFloor reported a security breach that resulted in the exchange's wallet with **24K BTC being stolen**.  The site was shuttered and access to customer funds denied as the exchange's reserves were insufficient to accommodate all funds deposited.  As of March 8, 2013, 3 months had passed since the last repayment (December 2012), and the operator had been unresponsive. (10.2)

On April 3, 2012, the website was down for several minutes. (10.3)
