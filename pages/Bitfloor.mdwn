**Bitfloor**, formerly a Bitcoin [[currency_exchange]] and trading platform site.


##History

The exchange had been operating since 2011 with its first publicity occurring in February 2012 (2.1).

On September 4, 2012 the operator of BitFloor reported a security breach that resulted in the exchange's wallet with **24K BTC being stolen**.  The site was shuttered and access to customer funds denied as the exchange's reserves were insufficient to accommodate all funds deposited.  As of March 8, 2013, 3 months had passed since the last repayment (December 2012), and the operator had been unresponsive. (2.2)

On April 3, 2012, the website was down for several minutes. (2.3)

BitFloor became a Money Service Business (MSB) registered with FinCEN (#31000005224108) on March 15, 2012. (2.4)

On April 17, 2013 the exchange halted operations after its bank was to close the exchange's bank account (2.5).
