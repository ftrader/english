A **Bitcoin Improvement Proposal** (**BIP**) is a design document for introducing features or information to Bitcoin. This is the standard way of communicating ideas since Bitcoin has no formal structure.

The first BIP ([[BIP_0001]]) was submitted by Amir Taaki on 2011-08-19 and described what a BIP is.

# BIP Types
There are three types of BIPs:

* **Standards Track BIPs** - Changes to the network protocol, block or transaction validation, or anything affecting interoperability.
* **Informational BIPs** - Design issues, general guidelines. This type of BIP is NOT for proposing new features and do not represent community consensus
* **Process BIPs** - Describes or proposes a change in process. Similar to Standards BIPs but apply outside the Bitcoin protocol.

# BIP Workflow
As described in [[BIP_0001]] the workflow of a BIP is as follows:
