A global news resource on Bitcoin and digital currencies. 

This London-based resource and news operation aims to be the “Reuters of Bitcoin” according to its founder Shakil Khan. As an angel investor in Spotify and bitcoin startup [[BitPay]], Khan noticed a gap in the news coverage for bitcoin and digital currencies in general when other entrepreneurs constantly questioned him about bitcoin. CoinDesk was launched on May 1st 2013<sup>[[1]]</sup>. In September 2013, [[Jon_Matonis]], executive director of the [[Bitcoin_Foundation]] joined CoinDesk as a contributing editor. 

##CoinDesk Information Centre
On August 21st 2013<sup>[[3]]</sup>, CoinDesk launched a [bitcoin information centre](http://www.coindesk.com/coindesk-launches-bitcoin-information-centre/). This contained guides on everything from the very basics of digital currency to how to set up your own bitcoin mining rig.

##CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index
CoinDesk launched a proprietary Bitcoin Price Index on September 11, 2013<sup>[[2]]</sup>. The Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) represents an average of bitcoin prices across leading global exchanges that meet criteria specifed by the BPI. It is intended to serve as a standard retail price reference for industry participants and accounting professionals.

Criteria for inclusion in the BPI are:

1. Exchange must serve an international customer base;
1. Exchange must provide a bid-offer spread for an immediate sale (offer) and an immediate purchase (bid);
1. Minimum trade size must be less than 1,500 USD or equivalent;
1. Daily trading volume must meet minimum acceptable levels as determined by CoinDesk;
1. Banking transfers in or out of the exchange must be completed within seven business days.

Upon launch, [[BitStamp]], [[BTC-e]] and [[CampBX]] met these criteria and were included in the index. 

The main features of the index are as follows:

* The CoinDesk BPI is a simple average of leading XBT/USD exchange prices;
* The BPI is expressed as the midpoint of bid/ask spread;
* The BPI is updated every 60 seconds;
* If an exchange does not update its price for more than 30 minutes, it is omitted from the live BPI calculation until it is updated again;
* New index historical data commences on 1 July 2013;
* Prior index historical data is obtained via Mt. Gox;
* End-of-day high, low, and closing BPI is based on Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) or British Summer Time (BST) when appropriate;
* Non-USD BPI prices are implied based on rates obtained via openexchangerates.org;

The CoinDesk BPI is now used by the [[Bitcoin_Foundation]]<sup>[[4]]</sup>, Bitcoin Insider and several charting platforms. A free [API is available for developers](http://www.coindesk.com/api/).
