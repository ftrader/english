**YouTipIt** is an online community service that enables you to directly reward people for content they have created.  

##Escrow Tipit

In addition to being able to send a tip to any user with a tipit badge, an escrow tipit may be sent to any user on Facebook.  An Escrow tipit sent is held in Escrow until the Facebook user claims the tipit (2.1).

The concept is essentially the same as that of the busker or street musician: they put their work in a public forum and the public then decides to reward them if they feel it is deserving.

Those who wish to tip may add funds by either sending Bitcoins to their [[eWallet]] with the site or by adding funds with [[PayPal]].  Funds added through PayPal may be spent as tips immediately however those tips must stay within the YouTipIt system for 45 days (2.2)

##History

The site underwent a rewrite and the switch to the revised software occurred on May 16th, 2011 (3.1).
