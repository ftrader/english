**Ideal Properties of Decentralized Digital Commodity**

If we had the ability to design and implement an ideal form of digital commodity money, what would it look like?  How does Bitcoin currently compare?


|Property |Ideal Implementation |Bitcoin's Current Rating (A..F) |Notes
|---|---|---|---
|Decentralized	|no single point of failure or issuing authority |A.
|Scarce	|required to be a reasonable store of value	|A.
|Divisible	|should be as close to infinitely divisible as possible  |B.
|Storage	|actual commodity should be cheap and easy to physically store securely |A.
|Irreversible Transactions |transactions should be irreversible |A.
|Anonymous	|untraceable transactions (if desired)  |C. |currently requires some trusted third party to obsfucate transactions
|Unspoofable	|should be exceedingly difficult to counterfeit  |A.
|Audit**	|publicly auditable balances, with account holder's permission |C. |since permission is not required
|Free Transactions |transactions should be free, or nearly free, forever	|B	|bitcoin future tx fees are a big unkown right now
|Example |Example |Example |Example

\**May not be a necessary property.  Thinking it would be cool if a known address could be audited via a tool like blockexplorer.com but if the coins are moved from that address, they are untraceable.
