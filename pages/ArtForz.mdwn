ArtForz is a regular on #bitcoin-dev. He was the first person to mine with GPUs, using private mining code that he wrote himself. He once held a high percentage of network computation power (~25%) but reports (1.1) that he now controls less than 1%.  He claims that his mining software is still more efficient than all other GPU miners. He uses a heavily-modified version of Bitcoin; notably, he requires less transaction fees and he doesn't perform IsStandard checks.

ArtForz has a very good understanding of Bitcoin. He reported [[serious bugs|incidents#LSHIFT_and_RETURN_bugs]] in Bitcoin's handling of certain [[script]] opcodes.
