Allows you to securely send bitcoins to any email address, even if the owner doesnâ€™t use Bitcoin.

##Criticisms

If the bitcoins are not claimed by the recipient within 14 days, the coins then go to the BitMail service (2.1).  The minimum payment transaction is 2 BTC, thus this service may not work for some micro payment needs.
