Allows you to securely send bitcoins to any email address, even if the owner doesnâ€™t use Bitcoin.

##Criticisms

If the bitcoins are not claimed by the recipient within 14 days, the coins then go to the BitMail service (2.1).  Though the minimum payment transaction was 2 BTC during its early days, now you can send even upto a minimum of 0.25 BTC.
