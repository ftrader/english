<big><big>I used a updata flag which is a four bytes word and 
is writed at fixd flash address (0x8000 - 4)

The flag's value is 0xAABBCCDD

When the bootloader program run, first it judge the updata flag,
if the updata falg is not equal 0xAABBCCDD,<br />
it will jump to application program.
otherwise it will run to updata program.</big></big>
