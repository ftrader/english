Simply locate the bitcoin address of the lottery you want to play and send bitcoin from your wallet. You will receive a ticket to the draw for every 0.001 bitcoin that you sent. You can also add 0.00005460 to your send (which is only around $0.05 or 0.035 Euros) in order to receive a confirmation of the transaction.

You can buy tickets to one or more lotteries and then all you have to do is wait and see if you have the lucky ticket!

	
Jackpot

Every day Betcoin.tm adds 0.1 BTC from their own pocket to each of the jackpots. This is the jackpot seed. They also add 0.00082 for every ticket purchased (82% of the price) so the jackpots grow every time someone buys a ticket!

The holder of the winning ticket gets the Jackpot amount and the 100 players who bought the most tickets share 3% of the total of the jackpot seed and the amount purchased. This way you can get a prize even if you are not the main winner!

The best part is that BetCoin ™ Prize is a provably fair lottery. You can use the draw algorithm  to verify that each winner was selected at random.

## Provably Fair

Provably fair gaming systems is a recent development in the casino world and it emerged on the scene with online Bitcoin gambling sites. This system of proof of work outcomes relies on cryptographic hashing functions, which make it possible to turn data into a string, referred to as a hash. The purpose of the hash is that it irreversible and therefore can be shown to the player without the player being able to decode the original data. This allows the casino to prove to the user, once the game is concluded and the server seed revealed, that it did not change the original server seed through out the game. 

Betcoin ™ uses hashing algorithm SHA265. Using this algorithm an initial hash is produced by combining a server generated seed and the initial array. This is essentially the houses shuffle. After this a Final Array is generated by combining a client seed and the initial array. This is the shuffle by the user. The client see is randomly generated and is open to direct change by the client. This way the user is can be certain of the authenticity of its random generation. The two seeds are used to calculate the result of the role. The server seed it then revealed to be verified by the client that it matches the hash.
	
	1.The server creates a secret random seed.
	2.The server seed is hashed and sent to the player.
	3.The player provides his own random client seed.
	4.The two seeds are used to calculate the result of the roll.
	5.The server seed is revealed, so the player can check that it matches the hash.
