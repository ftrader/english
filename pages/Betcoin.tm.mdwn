Betcoin Reels is structured with five different paths, allowing for five possible winning patterns. This is different from your standard casino one line slot machine. If you manage to land at least three symbols in a row on any of these five trajectories, ordering left to right, winnings are awarded to you. The amount of winnings depends on which symbol (the diamond cup paying the highest), as well as the number  of the same symbol in a row (five giving the highest payout, three the least). The structure of each reel consist of 8 different symbols arranged on each of the five reels. Each reel has a total length of 32 symbols before the pattern of repeats itself. This combination of symbol and reel patterns is done with precision to give a specific probability to each play. It is no mystery to the player what his or her chances per every given spin. The specific probability approximately 1.65% towards the house, which in compression to other slot machines probabilities is very competitive. 

## Provably Fair

Provably fair gaming systems is a recent development in the casino world and it emerged on the scene with online Bitcoin gambling sites. This system of proof of work outcomes relies on cryptographic hashing functions, which make it possible to turn data into a string, referred to as a hash. The purpose of the hash is that it irreversible and therefore can be shown to the player without the player being able to decode the original data. This allows the casino to prove to the user that it did not change the original string of data through out the game. 

Betcoin ™ uses hashing algorithm SH265. Using this algorithm an initial hash is produced by combining a server generated seed and the initial array. This is essentially the houses shuffle. After this a Final Array is generated by combining a client seed and the initial array. This is the shuffle by the user. The client see is randomly generated and is open to direct change by the client. This way the user is can be certain of the authenticity of its random generation. The two seeds are used to calculate the result of the role. The server seed it then revealed to be verified by the client that it matches the hash.
	
	1.The server creates a secret random seed.
	2.The server seed is hashed and sent to the player.
	3.The player provides his own random client seed.
	4.The two seeds are used to calculate the result of the roll.
	5.The server seed is revealed, so the player can check that it matches the hash.
