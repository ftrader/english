I'd like to see this as more of a bulleted table.  For example "Don't do this", "Do this", etc.  Perhaps a second column has the longer explanation, but the first column would essentially be TL;DR [Imsaguy](User:Imsaguy) ([[talk|User_talk:Imsaguy]]) 03:53, 9 May 2014 (UTC)

I'd prefer a document that explains the filosofy instead of a list of strict rules.  If you are going to define every rule, you will always end up on the losing side of a discussion with some person that just tries to find every hole in your rules, better to write philosophy and interprete it as we go imho :)   Also tl;dr is just an excuse.  Everybody is supposed to know the law, while in fact nobody knows the law... ([[talk|User_talk:kinlo]]) 12:50, 9 May 2014 (CEST)
