# Faucet History
How much did the faucet originally dispense? I see 0.05 in the page history, was that it? Just curious. [Meonkeys](User:Meonkeys) ([[talk|User_talk:Meonkeys]]) 15:40, 25 October 2012 (GMT)

Five bitcoins.  The faucet would automatically drop that by an order of magnitude to 0.5 BTC based on the balance remaining, IIRC.  That was before my time, and 0.5 BTC was the amount when I first learned of the faucet (mid-November 2010). - [Sgornick](User:Sgornick) ([[talk|User_talk:Sgornick]]) 19:08, 25 October 2012 (GMT)
