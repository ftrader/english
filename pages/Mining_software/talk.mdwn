## Stratum Extensions (section titled "Stratum Functionality")

I tried to find a source for the description of the "Transparency" feature of stratum protocol, and I didn't see it described anywhere in the spec:

* [Stratum - network protocol spec](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17zHy1SUlhgtCMbypO8cHgpWH73V5iUQKk_0rWvMqSNs/edit?hl=en_US#heading=h.pdck101h85p6) (google docs)

Is there an updated spec explaining the various (optional or otherwise) extensions?
