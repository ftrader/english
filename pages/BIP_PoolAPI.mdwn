  Title: ?
  Author: Paul Sheppard <shep(nospace)soft(at)gmail.com> and Luke Dashjr <luke+bip22@dashjr.org>

##Abstract
This BIP aims to create a standard API for pool statistics.

##Specification

Time is seconds since Jan 1 1970 midnight UTC.<br>
Hashrate is hashes per second.<br>
Satoshis is the smallest divisable part of the currency. i.e. for USD this is 0.01<br>

###Consistuent Structures


|colspan='3'shares
|---
|submitted |Number |shares submitted
|stale |Number |shares deemed stale by pool
|invalid |Number |shares deemed invalid by pool




|colspan='3'block
|---
|currency |String |BTC, NMC, Ix, iO, etc...
|id |Number |block ID
|duration |Time |block duration in seconds

|shares_user |Object 'shares' |shares for all workers of the user  for the round




|colspan='3'balance
|---
|currency |String |BTC, NMC, Ix, iO, etc...

|colspan='3'worker
|---
|id |String |unique worker identifier
|name |String |human-readable identifier for worker
|hashrate |Hashrate |current hashrate of the worker
|last_activity |Time |last submitted share time

###Main Structure


|colspan='3'user
|---
|pool_MOTD |String |whatever the pool wants to tell us
|pool_hashrate |Hashrate |current hashrate of the entire pool
|pool_users |Number |number of active users on the pool
|pool_workers |Number |number of active workers on the pool
|current_round |Array of 'block' |current active round
|user_hashrate |Hashrate |current hashrate of user for all workers
|last_activity |Time |last submitted share time of any user worker
|balances |Array of 'balance' |listing of each balance (BTC, NMC, etc.)
|workers |Array of 'worker' |listing of each worker of the user


Reward algorithms:


|Prop |Proportional
|PPLNS |Pay Per Last N Shares
|PPS |Pay Per Share
|SMPPS |Shared Maximum Pay Per Share
|Score |
|Geo |Geometric Method
|DGM |Double Geometric Method


###Example

##Motivation
Moving forward with bitcoin it is important to make all aspects as user friendly as possible. 

##Rationale
This BIP allows the creators of Apps and Web GUIs for pool monitoring a common interface to use, as opposed to dealing with a differing interface for each pool.

##Backwards Compatibility
As an emerging standard, backwards comparability is not applicable. However forward comparability should be maintained. Any future incompatibilities shall be identified by the 'API_version' number.
