Britcoin is the first UK [[exchange|currency_exchange]] offering GBP trading (BTC/GBP). As of August 2011, Britcoin is now named Intersango. Their deposit bank accounts have changed to represent this new change.

Traders add funds (GBP or BTC) to the site and then place orders to buy and sell. Britcoin acts as an escrow. The site charges no trading fees.

Funds are credited after trading immediately to accounts wherein they can be withdrawn off-site.

[[Bitcoin_Consultancy]] operates this exchange as well as the [[Intersango]] EUR exchange.

##Trading
You can trade bitcoins for money by entering either how many Bitcoins you want, or how much money you want for the coins. This "order" is then placed into the orderbook, where other users can accept offers and trade Bitcoins and currency smoothly. All the currency rates are handled by Britcoin itself.

###Buying

A buy order is executed partially or in full when the price bid can be matched against a sell order that is at or below the bid amount.

###Selling

A sell order is executed partially or in full when the price asked can be matched against a buy order that is at or above the ask amount.
