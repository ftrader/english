**PayPal** is an e-commerce business allowing payments and money transfers to be made through the Internet.
A PayPal account can be funded with electronic debits from a bank account, from a payment card or by receiving a money transfer from another PayPal member. Funds in a PayPal account can be withdrawn to a bank account or by sending a money transfer to another PayPal member.

##Fees
The fee for transferring money to another PayPal member can vary based on options.  The typical transaction charge for PayPal is $0.30 per transaction plus 2.9% of the amount transferred.  The transaction charge is deducted from the payment amount.  A "personal, payments owed" transaction to another PayPal account where the recipient's account is not a business account will incur no transfer fee.  International payments will incur an additional currency exchange fee of 1%, in many instances.

PayPal operates in 190 markets worldwide.
