**BtcPool.ru**, is a [[mining pool|Pooled_mining]].

BtcPool.ru's Mining Pool uses own scoring system.

To calculate users payouts we use special algorithm, which chooses eleven members of current round. This algorithm uses random numbers and numbers of shares received from users. (see [example](http://btcpool.ru/en/round.php?number=148390&round=TEST)).
That is, if you send at least one share, you get a chance to earn **25 à¸¿**. The more you send the shares, the greater will be your chance to win at current round.
