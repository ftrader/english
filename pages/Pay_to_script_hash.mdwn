**342ftSRCvFHfCeFFBuz4xwbeqnDw6BGUey**, [[firstbits]] [3](http://blockchain.info/fb/3), is a version-5 Bitcoin [[address]]. It is notable for being the first [[P2SH]]-compatible address, as well as the first address using a non-1 prefix, with a prefix of 3. As the address has held a maximum of 0.004 BTC, and currently holds no bitcoins, the address is evidently a test address.

## Analysis
The address has only received funds from a newly-generated mining address (1GLPEswBeEs31aCn6n5y5rDv1ckFp7L83U), which received coins in [[block]] 160720. As the generated [[transaction]] was distributed, a feature only seen on [[P2Pool]] and [[Eligius]], an operator of Eligius likely operated the address.
