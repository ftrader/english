Wall of Coins is a bitcoin exchange service owned and operated by Genitrust, Inc.It is a fully transparent peer-to-peer market for buying and selling Bitcoin. This is a first that is both a secure live and fixed exchange for the users. It is fully operating in Florida, America but has plans to expand globally in the near future. Wall of Coins directly connects buyers and sellers in a manner that is intelligent, trustworthy, and secure. We are also the first fully transparent market, and the first to store funds entirely in cold storage.


#Security and Transparency

##Deposit Addresses

In the interest of full transparency, all Wall of Coins deposit addresses are stored on this secure, separate server. We believe that all cryptocurrency markets should do this, so we are taking the lead. Wall of Coins' creators, Genitrust, Inc, will forever adhere to this policy, as it is simply the Bitcoin way: full transparency and entirely peer-to-peer. As the entire internet is currently not 100% peer-to-peer, we will do what we can to keep Wall of Coins, and its services such as the Index of Deposits, as peer-to-peer as possible.

Use this website to verify the authenticity of any deposit addresses supplied to you by Wall of Coins. This website is on a completely different server, and all you have to do to find and verify the authenticity of a deposit address is search this single-page website.

##GPG Verification

The company's GPG keys are hosted on a separate web server. Both the Wall of Coins company GPG key and our CEO's GPG key are used to sign the Index of Deposits.
