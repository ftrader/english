## User interaction
As one goal of this protocol is to properly abstract the User Interface from the Wallet, there are presumed to be no conditions where a Wallet itself has any direct user interaction. This is why it is left entirely to the Wallet implementation to decide if there may be circumstances that warrant leaving out the 'merchant' account. --[Luke-jr](User:Luke-jr) 06:16, 25 March 2011 (GMT)

## PKI to authenticate merchant
This doesn't seem like something we should be inventing just for Bitcoin. Surely there's some existing standard? I don't see why TLS client certs wouldn't work... --[Luke-jr](User:Luke-jr) 06:16, 25 March 2011 (GMT)
