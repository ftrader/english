**20/08/2013 SEPA Withdrawls Much Faster**

An update today in IRC from MagicalTux regarding SEPA transfers:

[[12:05]] <xxx> So if I withdraw with SEPA now, I can expect to get it in about a week?

[[12:05]] <@MagicalTux> ypep

[[12:05]] <@MagicalTux> yep*

[[12:05]] <@MagicalTux> or sooner

[[12:05]] <@MagicalTux> (we're catching back)

[[12:06]] <xxx> nice, whats the planned time once backlog cleared, daily?

[[12:06]] <@MagicalTux> xxx: yes



**05/08/2013 Gox Update (Includes announcements for LTC, New Trade Engines, Deposits and Withdrawls and Hardware Updates**

https://www.mtgox.com/press_release_20130805.html


**03/08/2013 Tips for Withdrawls (Thanks Sturles from IRC)**

You can withdraw JPY same day to a domestic Japanese bank account. I'm led to believe that anyone can get a bank account in Japan. Great option if you really need your Gox money now.


**24/07/2013 Additional Clarification on current withdrawls from MtGox**

*International Transfers* - Right now larger transfers of 5 digits or more are receiving priority over smaller transfers. Should you have multiple withdrawls underway, the value of these are added together and considered for this transfer priority.

*SEPA Transfers* - There are no official delays on SEPA transfers but, due to banking limits, larger transfers may still experience delays.


**24/07/2013 Litecoin in July?**

Extract from MtGox channel regarding Litecoin implementation in July.

[[06:32]] <xxxxx> MagicalTux is Mt.Gox still aiming to release Litecoin in July?

[[06:38]] <marionxd> xxxxx: no


This should not be taken as a never, however, simply that it won't be in July. For clarification, 'marionxd' is an MtGox employee.

## Websocket / API Changes

**26/07/2013 API Change**

For anyone calling ticker/etc directly from https://mtgox.com/api/* or https://mtgox.com/code/* now you are going through a proxy, and not directly to MtGox anymore. It is strongly suggested to switch to data.mtgox.com


**08/07/2013 Websocket Changes**

A new field has been added to the user_order broadcast. The field is called 'reason'. This field tells you exactly why an order has been removed from the order book. These are:

> * "requested" for when the customer manually requested the order to be cancelled
> * "completed_active" for orders that complete instantly (market orders and invalid orders)
> * "complete_passive" for limit orders


## Trading Questions

**Q. Is there a limit to open orders per account?**

Yes, 200. 


**Q. How are people submitting the same order on all currency trading books?**

They aren't. There is only one order book, the orders you see on one currency specific order book are also on all currency order books. There is a 2.5% currency conversion fee (added into the price). Eg. If someone buys in GBP from someone selling their BTC in EUR then the price of the EUR order appears in the order book as the price converted to GBP+2.5%.


## Deposits

Funds deposited with Mt.Gox must come from the bank account with the name that matches the owner of the Mt.Gox account.  Furthermore, funds may only be withdrawn to an account that is under the Mt.Gox account owner`s own name, except where transferring Bitcoins or other non-fiat currencies.


## Withdrawls

**Q. What do the individual statuses on Withdrawls mean?**

"confirmed' : In the MtGox withdrawl queue

"Pending" : Sent to the bank for processing.

"processed": Receipt confirmed from bank as transfer completed successfully


**Q. What's the process of transferring BTC out of mt.gox into to another person's wallet?**

You buy btcs with your currency then goto https://mtgox.com/trade/funding-options#withdraw, choose Bitcoins


**Q. How much does it cost to withdraw from Mt Gox?**

http://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/10207/around-eur-40-to-withdraw-from-mtgox


**Q. How long does it take to receive money when withdrawing using SEPA?**

The limits on mtgox's polish bank account limit the volume of SEPA transfers they do, so you might be stuck in the queue for a while, especially with larger transfers. If you need the money fast, use international transfer option.


**Q. Is okpay withdrawal still viable / working? (Added 24/06/2013)**

No. Even though this option is currently on the website, it will give you an error stating this method is not available anymore.

## Verification

**Q. How do I verify with no utility bills?**

A "certificate of residence" would do in this instance. If it is not in english, it may require an official translation to be accompanied with it.


## Website Related Info

**Q. I keep getting a 50x error everytime I log in. If i press F5 the page loads fine, what can I do?**

This is caused by a local caching issue. If you log out, clear your cookies, this should fix the issue going forward.


## What is a Bitcoin and how does it work?

A good series of videos from BitcoinTacticat is doing the rounds explaining bitcoins in plain english.

[Video Link](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q17oUUdjVec&list=PLcnASaMXwKnGUfv-GkOpM-oD1AmoJ36aO)


## Donations (Charity)

I do not require any personal donations, I'm here to help customers like me and to be a small help to the success of Bitcoin. 

If you do insist you want to donate, I have setup a generated a vanity bitcoin address which I will send all proceeds direct to Cancer Research UK. My father, sadly, lost his battle against Lung Cancer a few years ago so this is a very personal and worthy cause for us all to help beat it.

## How to rebroadcast transactions missing from the blockchain

**Single Transactions**

Please follow the following guide to re-broadcast your single transaction:

http://www.skanner.net/gethex.php



**Script to rebroadcast the lot from Mt Gox transaction file**

Note: This will only work if your bitcoind has fully synced to the blockchain. If in doubt, simply just do the transaction you want processed with the guide above.

This is a quick guide (For MS Windows) explaining how to rebroadcast all the transactions in the mtgox queue (http://data.mtgox.com/api/0/bitcoin_tx.php) that haven't arrived on the blockchain yet. 

You will need the following:

* PHP Installed - (http://www.php.net/downloads.php)
* This script - (http://pastebin.com/0cnDd8kQ) and name it mybroadcastbc.php
* Bitcoind.exe - (http://bitcoin.org/en/download) - Comes bundled with bitcoin-qt


1. Once php is installed, place the php script downloaded above and the bitcoind.exe in your php directory.
1. Open 2 command lines by clicking 'start' then type cmd and press enter.
1. Navigate to your php directory and then type 'bitcoind -daemon'. This will run a bitcoind instance which we will use to connect to the bitcoin blockchain. Once this step is done, you can minimise (NOT CLOSE) this window.
1. Now in the second command line, again navigate to your php directory and type 'php mybroadcastbc.php' and press enter. After a few seconds, you will see it trying to rebroadcast the transactions in the queue. It will end with a summary once finished. Thats all there is to this.


## My Transaction Won't Confirm!! Why?

There's two common reasons why a transaction might not confirm in a timely manner on the blockchain. First one is that ample transaction fee has not been added to the transaction. They will 'probably' be processed but they would not be a priority for miners and would take a long long time. 

The second reason could be that the transaction contains coins which are too new to have transactions for them. The bitcoin protocol requires 100 network blocks to pass after a new coin has been created to see any transaction which contains it as valid. If you check the source bitcoin addresses on your transaction on blockchain.info and click 'output' next to it, you can see if its a new coin and which block it was created in. Now if you find the latest block in the chain just by going to blockchain.info and look at the top 'height' number at the top left, it will show you which block the network is on now. Simply take the block now from the block number of the coin created and if its < 100 then you will need to wait the difference in blocks for your transaction to become valid. Approx time between blocks is 8 mins.
