## Trading Questions

**Q. Is there a limit to open orders per account?**

Yes, 200. 


**Q. How are people submitting the same order on all currency trading books?**

They aren't. There is only one order book, the orders you see on one currency specific order book are also on all currency order books. There is a 2.5% currency conversion fee (added into the price). Eg. If someone buys in GBP from someone selling their BTC in EUR then the price of the EUR order appears in the order book as the price converted to GBP+2.5%.


## Deposits

Funds deposited with Mt.Gox must come from the bank account with the name that matches the owner of the Mt.Gox account.  Furthermore, funds may only be withdrawn to an account that is under the Mt.Gox account owner`s own name, except where transferring Bitcoins or other non-fiat currencies.


## Withdrawls

**Q. What's the process of transferring BTC out of mt.gox into to another person's wallet?**

You buy btcs with your currency then goto https://mtgox.com/trade/funding-options#withdraw, choose Bitcoins


**Q. How much does it cost to withdraw from Mt Gox?**

http://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/10207/around-eur-40-to-withdraw-from-mtgox


**Q. How long does it take to receive money when withdrawing using SEPA?**

The limits on mtgox's polish bank account limit the volume of SEPA transfers they do, so you might be stuck in the queue for a while, especially with larger transfers. If you need the money fast, use international transfer option.


## Verification

**Q. How do I verify with no utility bills?**

A "certificate of residence" would do in this instance. If it is not in english, it may require an official translation to be accompanied with it.


## What is a Bitcoin and how does it work?

A good series of videos from BitcoinTacticat is doing the rounds explaining bitcoins in plain english.
