The [[MtGox]] API provides methods to access information from the market, place orders, and more.

Two APIs are currently available: 

* [[HTTP API|MtGox/API/HTTP]] 
* [[Streaming websocket API|MtGox/API/Streaming]]

##Number Formats

In the "old API", currency- and amount-values (price, volume,...) were given as **float**. These values are likely being deprecated and replaced by fields of the same name with "_int" as suffix. These are **fixed-decimal**, so you have to move the decimal point yourself (divide). The exponent differs based on the kind of the value.

In order to convert the **int** to a **decimal** you can...



|kind of field |...divide by |...multiply by
|---|---|---
|BTC (volume, amount) |1E8 (100,000,000) |0.00000001
|USD (price) |1E5 (100,000) |0.00001
|JPY (price) |1E3 (1,000) |0.001


Implementation advice: it's probably best to use **int** or **Decimal** (if your language/db offers such a type) in your clients. Using **float** will likely lead to nasty rounding problems.

## Currency Symbols

USD, AUD, CAD, CHF, CNY, DKK, EUR, GBP, HKD, JPY, NZD, PLN, RUB, SEK, SGD, THB

##Date and time

Most dates you will find in mtgox API are UNIX time

See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time

Most programming languages should have tools for managing those timestamps
