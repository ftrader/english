## API Version 2: 
v2 api is found at :

**https://data.mtgox.com/api/2/**

official docs are on  :

**https://github.com/MtGox/mtgox-doc**

The requested path (anything after the /2/) must now be included when you compute your hashed signature (Rest-Sign) for added security.

##### Explanation: 

This is how it was done for version 1:

You have your params(post_data) = the word nonce, followed by the actual *nonce* integer (params = [[(u'nonce',nonce)]])

You have your header made up of *Rest-Key* (your API-KEY) and *Rest-Sign* (a hashed signature)

Rest-Sign is created by doing : base64encode( HMAC hash( base64decoded(API-secret), the nonce, with SHA512 digest))

**What differs in version 2 is now** : BEFORE the nonce, you are adding the **relative path you are requesting**(ie: BTCUSD/money/ticker) **+ a NUL char (ascii code 0)**.

So in my python code below which is very readable you can see everything remains the same as API v1 except now we are using api2postdatatohash = path + chr(0) + post_data          #new way to hash for API 2, includes path + NUL.
