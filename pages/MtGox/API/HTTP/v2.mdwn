## API Version 2: 
The V2 API URL is:

**https://data.mtgox.com/api/2/**

### Documentation
**unofficial** documentation (So far the best we have) is provided at :

**https://bitbucket.org/nitrous/mtgox-api/overview** <br>
(The bitcointalk forum link is: **https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=164404.0**
<br>

**official** docs are on  :

##### Technical Use Explanation: 

The requested path (anything after the /2/) must now be included when you compute your hashed signature (Rest-Sign) for added security.

This is how it was done for version 1:

You have your params(post_data) = the word nonce, followed by the actual *nonce* integer (params = [[(u'nonce',nonce)]])

You have your header made up of *Rest-Key* (your API-KEY) and *Rest-Sign* (a hashed signature)

Rest-Sign is created by doing : base64encode( HMAC hash( base64decoded(API-secret), the nonce, with SHA512 digest))

**What differs in version 2 is now** : BEFORE the nonce, you are adding the **relative path you are requesting**(ie: BTCUSD/money/ticker) **+ a NUL char (ascii code 0)**.

**The URL is now ** something along the lines of BTCUSD/money/order/add instead of BTCUSD/private/order/add in api1. <br>
So in my python code below which is very readable you can see everything remains the same as API v1 except now we are using api2postdatatohash = path + chr(0) + post_data          #new way to hash for API 2, includes path + NUL.


BTCUSD/money/order/quote
<@MagicalTux> it estimate the result of running an order at a given price based on market depth

####Python v 2.7.3

http://pastebin.com/aXQfULyq - Remove any proprietary unlock_api_key stuff. You'll need [json_ascii](https://github.com/genbtc/trader.python/blob/master/lib/json_ascii.py) also. Works on API 0/1/2. Link to git-repo: [genbtc's trader.python](https://github.com/genbtc/trader.python/) <br>

####Perl
