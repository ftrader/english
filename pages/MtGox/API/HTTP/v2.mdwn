## API Version 2: 
**https://data.mtgox.com/api/2/**<br />

The requested path (anything after the /2/) must now be included when you compute your hashed signature (Rest-Sign) for added security.<br />

##### Explanation: 

This is how it was done for version 1: <br />

You have your params(post_data) = the word nonce, followed by the actual *nonce* integer (params = [[(u'nonce',nonce)]]) <br />

You have your header made up of *Rest-Key* (your API-KEY) and *Rest-Sign* (a hashed signature)<br />

Rest-Sign is created by doing : base64encode( HMAC hash( base64decoded(API-secret), the nonce, with SHA512 digest))<br />

**What differs in version 2 is now** : BEFORE the nonce, you are adding the **relative path you are requesting**(ie: BTCUSD/money/ticker) **+ a NUL char (ascii code 0)**.<br />

So in my python code below which is very readable you can see everything remains the same as API v1 except now we are using api2postdatatohash = path + chr(0) + post_data          #new way to hash for API 2, includes path + NUL. <br />
