## API Version 2: 
The V2 API URL is:

**https://data.mtgox.com/api/2/**

### Documentation
**Unofficial** documentation (So far the best we have) is provided at : https://bitbucket.org/nitrous/mtgox-api/overview (The bitcointalk forum link is: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=164404.0 )

**Official** docs are on: https://github.com/MtGox/mtgox-doc

##### Differences between v1 and v2: 

* The **URL** is now something along the lines of BTCUSD/money/order/add instead of BTCUSD/private/order/add in api1. All current known methods are found in the money category.
* The *requested path*  must now be included when you compute your **hashed signature (Rest-Sign)** for added security.<br><br> In version 1, Rest-Sign is created through base64-encoding the 256-digest HMAC hashing of your post data (which of course must include your nonce) with your API secret, previously base64 decoded. Now in version 2,  you must simply add *before* your post data the relative path you are requesting (anything after the /api/2/ base, ie: BTCUSD/money/ticker), concatenated with a NUL character (ASCII code 0). So the signature is now made starting from your relative path + NUL character + post data (which must include your nonce!).
