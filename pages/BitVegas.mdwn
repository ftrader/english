##Before You Join

Before you actually join the server, there are a few things you should know. 

###The Staff

The owner of the server can be extremely helpful and understanding. Unfortunately, he is hardly ever on and rarely responds to any kind of messaging. To counter this, he hired several staff members. One of which is someone you do NOT want to encounter. Any time a player has made a comment that could possibly put him or his actions in a negative light, he rants for a minimum of two hours, often saying "I'm going to stab somebody" or similar. Once, he muted a player globally and then proceeded to insult him for about an hour while he could not respond in any way. He has also been known to arbitrarily mute, ban, and kick players. That admin's name is DeviantTwo, so if you see him on the server then be sure to not say anything. The reason this is included in this page is that it truly ruins many player's experience of the server. Once banned a player has no claim to the bitcoins on their account.


There is little to no consistency in the punishment. One player stole thousands of dollars worth of Bitcoins from the server by exploiting a glitch, yet he has not been punished as he gave them back. Another player was permanently banned for posting a misleading advertisement for the server that lead players to believe they would be given administrative abilities upon joining.

###Server Downtime

The server often goes down without warning, sometimes for as long as a week, though usually somewhere around a day. The owner claims that no one loses money when the server goes down, but there have been claims of people losing as much as .1 BTC on bets that were never finished due to the server crashing.

###Rules

The server does not actually have any rules that players are informed of upon joining, yet the administrators tend to make a habit of banning people for things they deem "common sense". Players have been muted or banned for simply having an argument with another player. If you do get banned, do not expect a reason from that staff member.

###Bugs

There are some glitches in the server. For example, if you try to drink two alcoholic drinks one after the other then they both disappear. Admins do not reimburse players for things lost to server bugs, so be wary of the bar.

###BlackJack

Your standard BlackJack game. The player receives two cards, as does the dealer. Once the cards are dealt, the player has the option to "hit", or receive another card. At the end of the round, the players with the closest total card face value to 21 wins. If the player's total card value goes over 21 the player loses.

###Bacon Racing

An amusing recreation of horse racing. Four pigs are brought to the track where they wait for thirty seconds. During these thirty seconds, players are shown information such as the pig's chances of winning and the payout of betting on that pig. After the thirty seconds, the pigs race to the finish line. The pig in first place is the winner and the players who had bet on that pig are rewarded.

###Poker

Try to get a better hand than the other players!

[[!img "Pok_er.png" title="border" size=600x600]]

###Roulette

There is a board with thirty six numbers, zero through thirty six. Zero is the only green number, and the numbers from one through thirty six alternate between black and red. Players have the option to bet on individual numbers, corners connecting numbers, sides connecting numbers, dozens of numbers (first, second, third dozen), the color of the number, the column, whether the number will be even or odd, or you can bet on the first or second eighteen numbers. Payouts are directly proportionate to the odds of that particular event occurring. Players are allowed to bet on as many blocks as they like and will receive the payment they earn for every block they win.

###MineField

Players place a bet and then are locked in a room with a five by five square of grass. Each block has the potential to be a bomb. If a player mines a bomb, they lose the game. The player is allowed to cash out at any time. If they do this, they will receive their initial bet as well as anything they have won so far. There are two rooms, one has three bombs and the other has five. Both rooms have the same amount of grass. The number of Bitcoins received per non-explosive block mined is proportional to both the number of blocks already mined, the initial bet, and the number of bombs in the room.

###Referrals
Players receive .005(5mBTC) instantly as well as 5 [free gifts](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/BitVegas#Free_Gifts) for every player they get to join the server. When a player types "/referrals" in the game, they will be shown information regarding their referrals. This includes a link to their referral page, the number of referrals they have, and the number of times their referral page has been visited. A referral link is the same as a link to http://www.bitvegas.net, except that once visiting the referral link, the website logs the user's IP address. In order to get a referral, a player must share their referral link with a person who has not joined the server before. Upon joining the server, if the IP the user displays is the same as one that has been displayed on the player's referral page, the player will receive the referral reward.

The server has a help book for players so they can better understand the games. Players may acquire these by clicking the question mark at every game.
