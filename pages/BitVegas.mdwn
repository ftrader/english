It featured the most generous faucet of its time, yielding 0.002 BTC per hour to visitors.

BitVegas was a six story building. Across the six levels were a collection of games:


|Lottery|1, 4|[[!template id=yes Always]]|Hold'em|3|[[!template id=no]]|Minefield|2, 5|[[!template id=yes]]
|[[Drinking|BitVegas#Drinking_game]]|1-5|[[!template id=yes Always]]|Roulette|2, 5|[[!template id=yes]]|[[Race betting|BitVegas#Bacon_Races]]|4|[[!template id=yes]]
|Slots|2-5|[[!template id=yes]]|Blackjack|3, 5|[[!template id=yes]]|Parkour|6|[[!template id=no]]


###Floors
The building's six accessible levels were connected by elevators. The first floor served as the lobby, featuring a bar. Also connected to the first floor were two closed wings, a gift shop and a hotel. Neither of these wings would ever open, although it was possible to see their contents by freecamming. The second floor had two massive roulette tables and a slur of other games. The third floor had almost exclusively featured card games, and the fourth floor was centered on the [[Bacon Races|BitVegas#Bacon_Races]]. The fifth floor was reserved to users who had 1 BTC in their accounts, and had games with higher maximum bets. The top floor was technically the roof, and had several games of skill which did not allow betting.
##Mechanics
###Bacon Races
[[!img "BV_Piggies.png" size=120x120 title="The Bacon Races"]]Floor 4 featured Bacon Racing, which was a comical take on horse racing. Four pigs were given odds out of 100% to win the race, and players could stake bitcoins on those odds.
###Drinking game
Players could purchase alcoholic drinks from bars across the casino. Upon drinking a beverage, there was a 48% chance of the drinker finding double what they spent on the drink. Found bitcoins were in the form of chips in the bottle.
###Gift chest
Upon first joining the server, the number of free gifts a player may receive was set to thirty. Once every fifteen minutes, a player could go to a "Gift Chest" to receive a free gift of .5 mBTC. Players may increase their number of free gifts by referring other players. Referrals also paid 5 mBTC up front. This very generous subsidy sparked edit wars on the [Bitcoin wiki](Bitcoin:About).
