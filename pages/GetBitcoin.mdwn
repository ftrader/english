Formerly an [[exchange|currency_exchange]] service operating from July 2011 to September 2012.


##History

The service was launched July 3, 2011 (2.1).  The company GetBitcoin LLC is (?) registered entity in the State of Delaware (File# 4997818). Complaints began in September 2012 and the website has been down since then.

The service is not to be confused with the Australian web site [getbitcoin.com.au](https://www.getbitcoin.com.au), which offers a [fixed price exchange](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Buying_bitcoins#Fixed_Rate_Exchanges_.26_Others) service for bitcoins in Australia. The Australian business has nothing to do with the US company.
