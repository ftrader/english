According to wikipedia:

"Money is any object or record that is generally accepted as payment for goods and services and repayment of debts in a given country or socio-economic context. The main functions of money are distinguished as: a medium of exchange; a unit of account; a store of value; and, occasionally in the past, a standard of deferred payment. Any kind of object or secure verifiable record that fulfills these functions can serve as money."

## Bitcoins are:

* A record that is accepted as payment for goods and services, but not in the general case in a country. If it becomes more accepted in general, it would be money.
* It also meets all the main functions of money

So as long as it meets the fuzzy criteria of being generally accepted, it would be money according to the wikipedia definition.
