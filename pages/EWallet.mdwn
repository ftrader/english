An eWallet is an online account where bitcoins can be stored.  Examples include [Currency Exchanges](http://www.bitcoin.org/trade#Currency_exchange) and ecommerce transaction processors such as [MyBitcoin.com](https://www.MyBitcoin.com).

##Risks

When bitcoins are stored online with Currency Exchanges and ecommerce transaction processors such as MyBitcoin.com the ewallet provider retains full control of those amounts.

* There is no guarantee that the amount of bitcoins showing for the account holder's balance are truly being held in reserve by the ewallet provider.
* The ewallet provider's security may be vulnerable to theft as well.
