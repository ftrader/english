* Units are an objective measure; the cyan units are defined by SI, and the green by Tonal
* As far as application to BitCoin, there is no such thing as "official", as it is an authorityless system

Until tonal system is not widely used (at least it will be used by more than 1 person), it is rather confusing than useful to mention such units (even as proposal). So I simplify page to only units that is used.

Perhaps two pages are necessary, a Units_SI and a Units_Tonal and then a Units disambiguation page? - [Sgornick](User:Sgornick) ([[talk|User_talk:Sgornick]]) 04:36, 13 November 2012 (GMT)

* The colours work just fine for that. [Aleš Janda](User:Aleš Janda) doesn't seem to do anything but vandalise. --[Luke-jr](User:Luke-jr) ([[talk|User_talk:Luke-jr]]) 02:24, 25 November 2012 (GMT)

## Bugs

The tonal column contains many unprintable characters (Firefox on Ubuntu 12.10). What are they supposed to mean?
