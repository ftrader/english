* Units are an objective measure; the cyan units are defined by SI, and the green by Tonal
* As far as application to BitCoin, there is no such thing as "official", as it is an authorityless system

Until tonal system is not widely used (at least it will be used by more than 1 person), it is rather confusing than useful to mention such units (even as proposal). So I simplify page to only units that is used.

Perhaps two pages are necessary, a Units_SI and a Units_Tonal and then a Units disambiguation page? - [Sgornick](User:Sgornick) ([[talk|User_talk:Sgornick]]) 04:36, 13 November 2012 (GMT)

* The colours work just fine for that. [Aleš Janda](User:Aleš Janda) doesn't seem to do anything but vandalise. --[Luke-jr](User:Luke-jr) ([[talk|User_talk:Luke-jr]]) 02:24, 25 November 2012 (GMT)

## Bugs

The tonal column contains many unprintable characters (Firefox on Ubuntu 12.10). What are they supposed to mean? --[Goonie](User:Goonie) ([[talk|User_talk:Goonie]]) 16:37, 5 April 2013 (GMT)

* They're high-bit tonal digits, so they require a tonal-compatible font. [Here is one](http://luke.dashjr.org/education/tonal/glyphs/fonts/Luxi/LuxiTonal.ttf) that I made to fix with the Luxi Mono font family. --[Luke-jr](User:Luke-jr) ([[talk|User_talk:Luke-jr]]) 16:43, 5 April 2013 (GMT)

## User friendly subunit
We need a user friendly bitcoin subunit. The users usually use currencies with two decimal positions, so the proposal is to use the 1e6 subunit to have this two decimal positions.
The proposal for the name of this unit is microcoin where 1 bitcoin = 1,000,000.00 microcoins. We need also a currency symbol for this subunit, the proposal is to use the existing symbol 
whith unicode \u289 and html code &#649;

What do you think about?

* I think you mean micro-bitcoin, which already exists... --[Luke-jr](User:Luke-jr) ([[talk|User_talk:Luke-jr]]) 02:51, 29 October 2014 (UTC)
* @Luke I'm thinking about microcoin, is shorter than microbitcoin and in my opinion more user friendly because of the fact that microbitcoin seems 
as a micro part of bitcoin and psychologically the user wants to have a whole not a part of a coin, so bitcoin is the unit and equivalent to 1,000,000.00 of microcoins.
