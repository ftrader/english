A hosted (shared) web-based [[EWallet]] used for sending, receiving and storing bitcoins.  This is not to be confused with the data structure in the blockchain which is also named coinbase.  This also is not to be confused with a podcast series called Coinbase that was produced by AgoristRadio.com.

The service aims to be the easiest way to get started with Bitcoin.  Its service is modeled to provide an experience familar to those who are comfortable using PayPal.

##Transactions

###Buy Bitcoins

####U.S.

Coinbase allows users to purchase bitcoin by directly transferring money from a bank account. The exchange rate used is locked in at the time of purchase, but for first-time users the bitcoin is not available until the bank transfer completes, which takes three to four business days. For verified users, the bitcoin is available immediately.

Linking a bank account can be done using Instant Account Verification (by providing your bank account credentials) or through a Challenge Deposit method which takes 2-3 business days to complete.

###Sell Bitcoins

####U.S.

Proceeds from selling bitcoins are sent as a direct ACH transfer to a linked bank account. The price is locked upon executing the sell and the funds arrive in the bank account in 2-3 business days.

###Send Money

This feature provides the ability to send bitcoin to an e-mail address or to a bitcoin address. The amount of bitcoin sent can be determined by entering a value in USD, which will be automatically converted to the equivalent value of bitcoin based on the current market exchange rate. If bitcoin is sent to an email address not currently registered with Coinbase, an account will automatically be created and a message will be sent to that email address prompting the user to verify the account and claim the bitcoin.

###Request Money

This feature provides the ability to request funds (denominated in either USD or BTC) through an invoice which will be sent by email.
