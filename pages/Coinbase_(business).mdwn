website=[coinbase.com](https://www.coinbase.com/)}}**Coinbase** is a hosted web-based [[eWallet]] used for sending, receiving, and storing bitcoins.  Users can also connect a U.S. based bank account to buy and sell bitcoin via bank transfer.

The service aims to be the easiest way to get started with Bitcoin, modeled to provide an experience familiar to those who are comfortable using PayPal.

##Transactions

###Buy Bitcoin

Coinbase allows users to purchase bitcoin by directly transferring money from a bank account. Although the exchange rate is locked in at the time of order placement, the Bitcoin is not released for four business days.  Verified users are allowed to create instant-purchases, which credits the Bitcoin to their account before the bank transfer clears.  

Linking a bank account can be done using Instant Account Verification (by providing your bank account credentials) or through a Challenge Deposit method which takes 2-3 business days to complete.  The bank verification process is very similar to the relevant procedure at PayPal.

###Sell Bitcoin

Proceeds from selling bitcoins are sent as a direct ACH transfer to a linked bank account. The price is locked upon executing the sell and the funds arrive in the bank account in 2-3 business days.  

###Send Money

This feature provides the ability to send bitcoin to both email and Bitcoin addresses. The amount of bitcoin sent can be determined by entering a value in either USD (converted to Bitcoin based on the current exchange rate) or Bitcoin.  If bitcoin is sent to an email address not currently registered with Coinbase, an account will automatically be created and a message will be sent to that email address prompting the user to verify the account and claim the bitcoin.

###Request Money

This feature provides the ability to request funds (denominated in either USD or BTC) through an invoice which is sent by email.

###Exchange

On January 26, 2015 Coinbase announced via a blog post  (7.1) they were launching a United States based and US regulated bitcoin exchange. The exchange located at [https://exchange.coinbase.com/](https://exchange.coinbase.com/) allows users from select US states and territories begin trading using an order book on the Coinbase website.

##Merchant Tools

[Payment buttons](https://developers.coinbase.com/docs/merchants/payment-buttons) make it easy to accept bitcoin on any website by copying and pasting a few lines of code.

[Payment pages](https://developers.coinbase.com/docs/merchants/payment-pages) allow merchants to accept bitcoin with a hosted checkout page on coinbase.com.

[Callbacks](https://developers.coinbase.com/docs/merchants/callbacks) allow for instant payment notifications to a merchant's website.

[Payouts](https://developers.coinbase.com/docs/merchants/payouts) allow merchants to cash out bitcoin on a daily basis through a USD transfer to a linked bank account without exchange rate risk.

Coinbase also offers an [API](https://developers.coinbase.com/docs/wallet) for custom applications or merchant integrations.

##Fees

There are no fees for sending, receiving, or storing bitcoin.

The fee for buying or selling bitcoin with a bank transfer is a fixed 1% + $0.15.  This fee is waived on automatic sell orders made using their merchant instant-exchange functionality.
