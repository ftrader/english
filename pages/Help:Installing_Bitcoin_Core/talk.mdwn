## Source for informations

We should be able to port part of the existing documentation on [(1)](http://www.bitcoin.org/wiki/doku.php?id=getting_started), would just need rewrite/cleanup and adaptation to be more newbie-friendy. [MagicalTux](User:MagicalTux) 17:24, 17 December 2010 (GMT)

## nanotube changes

Incorporated the work in progress I had on http://wiki.bitcoin-otc.com/wiki/Bitcoin_Howto. Page is starting to shape up pretty nicely. :) --[Nanotube](User:Nanotube) 04:46, 24 December 2010 (GMT)
> I appreciate your writing and know you also want to make this article great. Please don't take this offensively but I rolled back your changes. This page is the very first page for beginners and those details are very wordy and off-putting. I deliberately made sure to keep words in the article to a minimum and have big huge pictures. For your howto I do think it's valuable and should be on this wiki, but lets plan this first. We can either tag it on the end of this for people who wish the continue on deeper and further (now that they've been hooked in) or put it in a seperate article (might be redundant). Anyway looking forward to your thoughts. Lets shape this up. [Genjix](User:Genjix) 16:50, 7 January 2011 (GMT)
> Really bad form to roll back all my edits without discussing first. I think a more detailed page is more useful to have - after all our audience /at this point/ is not people who don't know how to download a file and install, but people who want to know how the system works and whether they can trust it. I think we should put this to a vote of the wiki community. If it is decided that it's more useful to keep a "how to click" page for noobs under 'getting started', then so be it, and I'll put my content under a separate page. And once again - really bad form on your part to do this. --[Nanotube](User:Nanotube) 23:53, 8 January 2011 (GMT)
> I understand how those information may not fit exactly into the goal of the [[Getting_started]] page, which as its name implies is just a page to get started with bitcoin and may not need all the extra details. I could have been better however to discuss the issue before rolling back the changes, especially since both of you are on IRC (fast & easy way to discuss this). Maybe we should also include on pages their intended use & writing guidelines on the discussion page (just throwing an idea). [MagicalTux](User:MagicalTux) 00:16, 9 January 2011 (GMT)
> Do you know how confusing it is for a person who's barely competent and doesn't yet understand Bitcoin? People HATE reading huge paragraphs of text, and if they need that info then they're better served by going elsewhere on this wiki. Providing users with multiple options: you can do this OR this OR this OR this... is incredibly confusing. We want to get them started now at the most basic level, assuming that they have 0 attention (big pretty pictures, simplistic instructions).
> After they have Bitcoin running, and some BTC to play with, then we can begin to introduce them to alternatives and explain complex things. Simply hurling the thick manual at their head makes people run away. We want to gradually bring them in. Small steps. Push their boundaries slowly rather than quickly. As the page was before, it was too much info, too fast. Remember this is the 'getting started' (begin here, step 1, start here, ...) page for the absolute lowest tier beginner.
