## Source for informations

We should be able to port part of the existing documentation on [(1)](http://www.bitcoin.org/wiki/doku.php?id=getting_started), would just need rewrite/cleanup and adaptation to be more newbie-friendy. [MagicalTux](User:MagicalTux) 17:24, 17 December 2010 (GMT)

## nanotube changes

Incorporated the work in progress I had on http://wiki.bitcoin-otc.com/wiki/Bitcoin_Howto. Page is starting to shape up pretty nicely. :) --[Nanotube](User:Nanotube) 04:46, 24 December 2010 (GMT)
> I appreciate your writing and know you also want to make this article great. Please don't take this offensively but I rolled back your changes. This page is the very first page for beginners and those details are very wordy and off-putting. I deliberately made sure to keep words in the article to a minimum and have big huge pictures. For your howto I do think it's valuable and should be on this wiki, but lets plan this first. We can either tag it on the end of this for people who wish the continue on deeper and further (now that they've been hooked in) or put it in a seperate article (might be redundant). Anyway looking forward to your thoughts. Lets shape this up. [Genjix](User:Genjix) 16:50, 7 January 2011 (GMT)
> Really bad form to roll back all my edits without discussing first. I think a more detailed page is more useful to have - after all our audience /at this point/ is not people who don't know how to download a file and install, but people who want to know how the system works and whether they can trust it. I think we should put this to a vote of the wiki community. If it is decided that it's more useful to keep a "how to click" page for noobs under 'getting started', then so be it, and I'll put my content under a separate page. And once again - really bad form on your part to do this. --[Nanotube](User:Nanotube) 23:53, 8 January 2011 (GMT)
