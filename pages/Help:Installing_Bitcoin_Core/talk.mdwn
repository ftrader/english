## Source for informations

We should be able to port part of the existing documentation on [(1)](http://www.bitcoin.org/wiki/doku.php?id=getting_started), would just need rewrite/cleanup and adaptation to be more newbie-friendy. [MagicalTux](User:MagicalTux) 17:24, 17 December 2010 (GMT)

## nanotube changes

Incorporated the work in progress I had on http://wiki.bitcoin-otc.com/wiki/Bitcoin_Howto. Page is starting to shape up pretty nicely. :) --[Nanotube](User:Nanotube) 04:46, 24 December 2010 (GMT)
> I appreciate your writing and know you also want to make this article great. Please don't take this offensively but I rolled back your changes. This page is the very first page for beginners and those details are very wordy and off-putting. I deliberately made sure to keep words in the article to a minimum and have big huge pictures. For your howto I do think it's valuable and should be on this wiki, but lets plan this first. We can either tag it on the end of this for people who wish the continue on deeper and further (now that they've been hooked in) or put it in a seperate article (might be redundant). Anyway looking forward to your thoughts. Lets shape this up. [Genjix](User:Genjix) 16:50, 7 January 2011 (GMT)
