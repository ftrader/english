## Tor + Firefox

I recommend to start with the Vidalia Bundle.
There Tor comes with a graphical control centre + Tor button for Firefox. 
the Tor button is a plugin that allows you with 1 click to turn on/off the Tor routing for Firefox.

## Tor + Bitcoin

using Bitcoin with Tor is easy. All you need is to check the proxy option. The predefined values in Bitcoin match the Tor settings. As Bitcoin only saves from & to addresses (and no IP addresses), you should be pretty safe. Tor however does not fix the traceability of BTC from one address to other.

## Tor + IRC (mIRC)

This is worked for me on two different computers, drop me a message on Bitcoin forum if you need help.
