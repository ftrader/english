Here we analyze the [[nonce]] values and [[hashes|hash]] for all the valid blocks in the [[blockchain]]: (1.1)

##Time Evolution
###Nonces vs Hashes (y-axis logarithmic, x-axis linear)
This plot readily shows that the distribution of [[nonces|nonce]] that produce valid [[hashes|hash]] is uniform.<br>[[!img "Nonces_vs_Hashes.png" title="verba alia"]]

###Nonces vs Hashes (log-log scale)

In the animated version of this last plot, (4.1) you can really visualize the change in the [[difficulty]] and even see where the [[difficulty]] was decreased.

##Histograms
The nonces found are skewed toward 0 because this is a selection effect: most everyone starts searching for nonces starting at 0:<br>[[!img "Nonces_Histogram.png" title="histogram of nonces"]]

Although the distribution of hashes is not uniform, this does not matter; all that matters is that the distribution of nonces is uniform (which they are, minus the selection effect of starting at 0):<br>[[!img "Hashes_Histogram.png" title="histogram of hashes"]]

2-D histogram of hashes and nonces (logarithmic color scale):<br>[[!img "Density_Plot_(log_colorscale).png" title="Density Plot (log colorscale)"]]

This also illustrates very well that the distribution of nonces is uniform.
