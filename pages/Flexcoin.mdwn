Flexcoin is an [[EWallet]] run by Flexcoin Inc in Edmonton Alberta Canada.


Flexcoin differentiates itself from [[EWallet]](s) by providing a paid "discount" to account holders.  It generates revenue by charging small transaction fees on outgoing bitcoins but no fees are charged from flexcoin to flexcoin accounts.  These fees are for the most part forwarded back to the account holders via a "discount" payment.  


Flexcoin has been running on an invite only process in June 2011,  invites were filled within minutes of releasing them. 
Flexcoin went live on August 4th 2011 to the general public.
Flexcoin was sold from [Yooter](http://www.yooter.com) to a group of Edmonton based investors, headed by James Gray on March 14th 2012.


Flexcoin offers users an alternative to Bitcoin addresses in the form of personalized addresses:

Example :  
<br>
Bitcoin: Pay for your coffee at bitcoin address 1555hjPG7pRwTHVMfukPvjXexQMHFE3qu6
<br>
flexcoin: Pay for your coffee with flexcoin id **coffeeshop**
<br>


As with most [[EWallet]]s, transfers within flexcoin are instant, meaning no next block wait.

Flexcoin was one of the first bitcoin eWallets based in the United States and is the first to label itself as a "bank" (though not legally registered as a bank).
