Flexcoin bills itself as the first bitcoin bank.

Run by Yooter InterActive Marketing in Pottsville, PA it allows for a central location for all bitcoin only transactions.  

Flexcoin differentiates itself from [[EWallet]](s) by providing interest to the account holders.  Though it is an active miner it also generates revenue by charging small transaction fees on outgoing bitcoins but no fees are charged from flexcoin to flexcoin accounts.  These fees and mining proceeds are for the most part forwarded back to the account holders via an interest payment.

The bitcoin bank has been running on an invite only process since June 2011 and current has several hundred users.

It is one of the first bitcoin eWallets based in the United States and is the first to label itself as a "bank".
