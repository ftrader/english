###Principles of Bitcoin

All changes and upgrades to the protocol should strive to maintain and reinforce these [[Principles_of_Bitcoin]]

* **21 million coins.**     
* **No censorship:** Nobody should be able to prevent valid txs from being confirmed.
* **Open-Source:** Bitcoin source code should always be open for anyone to read, modify, copy, share.
* **Permissionless:**  No arbitrary gatekeepers should ever prevent anybody from being part of the network (user, node, miner, etc).
* **Pseudonymous:** No ID should be required to own, use Bitcoin. 
* **Fungible:** All coins are equal and should be equally spendable.
* **Irreversible Transactions:** Confirmed blocks should be set in stone. Blockchain History should be immutable.
