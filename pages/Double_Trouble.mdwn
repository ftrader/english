The online casino game **Double Trouble** approximates a virtual coin-flip game of chance.  

If the virtual coin flip turns up heads, the payout returned is 200% of the amount bet -- double the amount wagered, and thus the name Double Trouble.  The flip that turns up tails is deemed Trouble and the entire amount wagered is lost.
