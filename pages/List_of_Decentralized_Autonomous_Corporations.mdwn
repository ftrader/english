Bitcoin, the first DAC?

Bitcoin forks

Ripple Labs is borderline ... they are a registered company and could be ordered to shutdown. The protocol is perhaps a DAC.

Mastercoin, a DAC replacement for Forex, Shares, and much more.

ProtoShares, a meta DAC with the purpose of privding infrastructure for other DACs. It is composed of
- DomainShares, a DAC replacement for Namecoin
- BitShares, a competitor to Mastercoin (with much more limited feature set IMHO)
- Keyhotee, a DAC replacement for OpenID
- Other infrastructure components to follow... ? 

Mitosys - a DAC replacement for Bit-Message

Colored Coins are working on defining themselves as a DAC ... I haven't seen a working business model yet.
