The five paragraphs in Technical Background all say the same thing. --[Mcandre](User:Mcandre)

Note: the backupwallet.sh script in the linux section doesn't actually work.
I suspect it is caused by the wiki changing the formatting.
I wrote my own version that uses much more standard shell syntax.

I fixed the backupwallet.sh script. It just needed a nowiki tag around a conditional statement. -- [Mweather](User:Mweather) 23:48, 20 May 2011 (GMT)

The approach for "Making a secure workspace" seems to differ greatly for linux and mac. Why? It seems like if you are going to make firefox secure, which is basically all the linux section recommends, you would want to do that on a mac too. And the recommendation in the mac section to keep the wallet in an encrypted volume with a symlink in the expected system location should be done on a linux box too, shouldn't it, like using truecrypt or something... Am I wrong??? Can someone with advanced knowledge please advise...? Also, if you want bitcoin to run all the time in the background on linux, but you have it set up in a separate user from your main user account, well, you are out of luck? Can justifications and explanations be added to the recommendations, and also I guess some alternatives with pros and cons be offered, for people with different needs and computing situations. Thanks! --[GusGustavo](User:GusGustavo) 13:33, 26 May 2011 (GMT)

## Time Sensitivity

Is it possible to still send money to my wallet, even if it's backed up and offline?  Do bitcoins ever expire if they're not spent, or is there anything bad that can happen by not using my bitcoin client in a long time? [Daniel.benoy](User:Daniel.benoy) 23:18, 8 June 2011 (GMT)

## Creating a New Wallet

This section isn't helpful; it tells you when to create a new wallet, but not how.  I'm a new user, and the wallet was created when I installed the BitCoin program.  I will find out how to create a new wallet, and then edit this section so that it actually explains the task that it sets out to explain. :-) [ErgoOne](User:ErgoOne) 15:19, 9 June 2011 (GMT)
