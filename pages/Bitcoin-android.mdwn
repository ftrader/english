<span style="color:red;">This app is not being maintained any more, and it doesn't implement the current Bitcoin p2p protocol. It requires a rooted phone and a lot of manual work to retrieve your coins from this app.</span>

A client and wallet application for Android mobiles that allows bitcoins to be sent and received.

A message on the app's project page warns:
<span style="color:red;">This app is still under development and may lose your coins! Test it with small amounts.

This app implements the Bitcoin protocol natively and does not require service from an RPC host or [[eWallet]].  This app is based on the [[BitCoinJ]] library.
