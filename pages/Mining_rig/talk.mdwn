Love the multi-tiered structure.  One question... 5850's are mentioned a lot on the forums.  Combining two of them together seems to get you to the 700 M/hash range, and costs under $470 ($185-$235 each) vs $734 for the 6990.  But I'm not very experienced and haven't done this myself yet, just been looking into it.  Is there a reason to opt for the 6990? --[Paperfree](User:Paperfree) 04:05, 18 May 2011 (GMT)
