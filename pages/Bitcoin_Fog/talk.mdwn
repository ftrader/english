## Protecting links

In order to prevent the insertion of malicious or fraudulent links onto this page, I will be locking the page. It can still be edited at [[Template:Bitcoin Fog content]]. This is so that users can contribute information without being able to tamper with the links. [Taras](User:Taras) ([[talk|User_talk:Taras]]) 15:49, 14 September 2014 (UTC)
