It would be nice, if you enable editing this page, because Bitcoin Fog scammed a lot of people. [[!template id=unsigned Pampa 20:19, 5 March 2015â€Ž (UTC)]]
> Changes can be made [here](Bitcoin:ContentPages/Bitcoin_Fog). The links are locked, not the content of the page. I think we should ban mixing services from the wiki anyways; they're 99% fraud and pretty useless.

## Protecting links

In order to prevent the insertion of malicious or fraudulent links onto this page, I will be locking the page. It can still be edited at [[Template:Bitcoin Fog content]]. This is so that users can contribute information without being able to tamper with the links. [Taras](User:Taras) ([[talk|User_talk:Taras]]) 15:49, 14 September 2014 (UTC)

This page links to a phishing site. The first link is to bitcoinfog.CO. The real site is .COM.
