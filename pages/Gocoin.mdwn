An open-source Bitcoin solution written in Go language (golang).

Can be built for every platform that has a working Go compiler.

Gocoin is licensed under GPL version 3.

##Features

###Client

* All the unspent outputs are kept in memory, so switching between different wallets is very fast.
* Allows a user to limit the upload and download network bandwidth used by the client.

###Wallet

* For security reasons, it is supposed to be used with a PC that has never been connected to a network.
* The wallet is deterministic and a seed-password based, so as long as you remember the password, you do not need to backup it, ever.
* Additionally you can import private keys for your existing bitcoin wallet.
* Has very low hardware requirements, so you can use it with i.e. Raspberry Pi

##Requirements
The client node requires 64-bit platform and at least 4GB of system memory.

##Limitations

* No GUI
* Works only with entire (mined) blocks - does not rely transactions, except from sending own transactions to the network
* Requires a file system that supports large files (bigger than 4GB)

##History

Gocoin was written by a single person for a private purposes.
The software's first public release was announced in May 2013 on Bitcointalk forum.
