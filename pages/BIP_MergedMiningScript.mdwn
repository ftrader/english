* <Block header is on stack>
* OP_SHA256d
* PUSH...: various other merged chains as merkle links
* PUSH: N of merkle links
* OP_MERKLEROOT_FROMLINKS

Inside parent chain coinbase:

* PUSH: coinbase prefix midstate
* OP_SWAP
* OP_SHA256FINISH
* OP_SHA256 (to get a SHA256d result; the parent chain coinbase's txid)
* PUSH...: various other transactions in parent chain (as merkle links)
* PUSH: N of merkle links
* OP_MERKLEROOT_FROMLINKS (stack now has the parent chain tx merkleroot)
* PREPEND: parent chain version
* APPEND: parent chain header ending
* OP_SHA256d (stack now has the proof-of-work)

Dedicated merged mining:

* APPEND: 16-bit time offset
* APPEND: 48-bit nonce
* OP_SHA256d
