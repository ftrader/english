# Payment Requests

Payment Requests are a proposed new way to make Bitcoin payments.

Instead of sending somebody a bitcoin address and asking them to pay to that address, you give them a PaymentRequest message which bundles up more information than is contained in just a bitcoin address. A SignedPaymentRequest bundles a PaymentRequest with a digital identity and signature, so you can be sure that you are paying the correct person or merchant.

## Specification

See https://gist.github.com/4120476 for the current specification. After some prototyping it is expected the specification will become one or more BIPs.

## Extensions
