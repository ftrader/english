Suggestion: be more explicit that the version in the protocol is a 32-bit integer, that 0.6.0 is represented by the number 60000, and that the 'subversion' field is an arbitrary string.

Just as a point of information; "git describe" output solves the problem of non-incremental committish.  It does this by providing a base version code (the most recent tag name) the number of commits past that tag and then a little bit of the commitish for the revision in question.
