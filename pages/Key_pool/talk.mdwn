I see the advantage being:

	1. I backup my wallet
	2. I sent some money
	3. The 'change' of the transaction is sent to a new address in my pool
	4. My harddrive crashes
	5. I restore wallet from backup
	6. My 'change' is intact because the entire pool was restored.


Concern:

	2.b. I make 300 transactions
	..
	6.b. Have all lost the 'change' to all transactions after the 100th?


Solution:

	3.a. The 'change' is sent to a random (or cycled) address in the pool without generating a new address (key pair).
