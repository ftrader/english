**Splash** is a hard-fork of [Ripple](https://ripple.com/). It has the same dual functionality of both a built-in pure cryptocurrency (*splashes*, XSP, by analogy with Ripple's *ripples*, XRP), not involving any relationship with a counterparty, and facilities for managing credit and debt relationships between counterparties, denominated in any other currency.

Splash differs from Ripple in that the built-in currency is [[mined|Mining]] - created by proof of work - rather than declared to exist by software fiat from the beginning. All else is unchanged. In particular, the history of transactions is validated by Ripple's consensus algorithm, not by proof of work.

Splash is currently in development. A forum announcement by [Iain Stewart](User:Ids) should follow shortly.
