Karsha Shopping Cart Interface is a portion of [[Karsha_Mobile_Payment_Interface]] which enables its users to accept Bitcoin and [[Liberty_Reserve]] payments through the buyer's mobile phone's browser.

### Referral system for merchants
Merchant will be automatically participated in the 3-level referral system when they redirect their customers to Karsha Shopping Cart Interface. So, when a merchant's customer opens a new Karsha Bitcoin account or logs in to his [[Liberty_Reserve]] account for the first time, the merchant who redirected him to the SCI will be registered as his referrer. But merchants may override this to build their own referral system based on Karsha referral system. More information and the complete guide for participating in the referral system are available [here](https://karsha.biz/?do=ref).
