It is also the most valuable physical bitcoin ever produced, with one selling for $1 million in 2013. The token is made of an ounce of fine gold, which at the time of production was about one third the value of the 1000 BTC. The coin could be ordered directly from Casascius for approximately $5,500.

As the value of bitcoin rose through the [[April|April_2013_bubble]] and [[November_2013_bubble]]s, the value of this unopened token quickly appreciated, going from $10,000 to $1 million. As of March 2015, a reasonable price is $300,000.
