Should there be a seperate page for Bitcoin Core? Or do we keep everything here, beause nobody uses the term Bitcoin Core anyway? [Newar](User:Newar) ([[talk|User_talk:Newar]]) 08:21, 19 September 2014 (UTC)

>  IMO, distinction between bitcoind (Bitcoin Core Daemon) and Bitcoin-Qt (Bitcoin Core GUI) is necessary. But how they're named is debatable as long as there's redirects for obvious aliases. --[Luke-jr](User:Luke-jr) ([[talk|User_talk:Luke-jr]]) 17:01, 19 September 2014 (UTC)
