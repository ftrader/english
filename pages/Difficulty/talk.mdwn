*Difficulty is a measure of how difficult it is to find a new [[block]] **compared to the easiest it can ever be**.*  

What does this mean?

> I could be wrong, but I believe it means that if the difficulty is 10, then it is 10x more difficult to find a block compared to a difficulty of 1, which means that it will take 10x as long to find a new block, on average. Someone please correct me if I'm wrong so we can rewrite that phrase --<span style="text-shadow:orange 0px 0px 3px;"><font color="#FF6600"><tt><big><u>****</u></big></tt></font>[Firestorm](User:Firestorm)</span> 02:10, 31 May 2011 (GMT)
