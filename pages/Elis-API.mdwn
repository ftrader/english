Bitcoin API call list (as of version 0.3.20.2) with code samples and returned values.

## API Calls

API Calls to JSON-RPC are sent using POST method and parameters are sent as JSON object.

### Example Request

When requesting something from the JSON-RPC server the request is sent to the server with the following URL: <tt>http://user:pass@localhost:8332/</tt> with post data that looks something like this:

<syntaxhighlight lang="javascript">{"method":"listreceivedbyaccount","params":[[0]],"id":"listreceivedbyaccount"}:</syntaxhighlight>

The Bitcoind server user JSON notation instead of using regular POST parameters which can cause confusions sometime. Note the trailing colon on the post data above.

The JSON object that is being sent to the server is composed of 3 elements: <tt>method</tt>, <tt>params</tt>, and <tt>id</tt>.

<strong><tt>method</tt></strong> is what method you want to invoke, this is a simple string representing the method you're invoking.

<strong><tt>params</tt></strong> is the <strong><tt>Array</tt></strong> parameters that you're sending with the method invocation. Note that these parameters are sent as an <tt>Array</tt> notation and not <tt>Object</tt> notation.
