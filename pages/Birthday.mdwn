The [Happy Birthday Bitcoin](http://www.happybirthdaybitcoin.com) website highlights many milestones along Bitcoin's journey since the [[Genesis_Block]].

The mastermind behind [[Bitcoin]], [[Satoshi_Nakamoto]], released his [whitepaper](http://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf) discussing the protocol on 1st Nov 2008.

After much conjecture about when Bitcoin's birthday actually is, the consensus falls to the creation of the Genesis Block, which was mined on 3rd Jan 2009.
