What is "Isolated" wallet security? Is this some Android thing? --[Luke-jr](User:Luke-jr) ([[talk|User_talk:Luke-jr]]) 00:15, 10 July 2012 (GMT)

## Orientation

Eventually there will be too many clients and the table will be too wide, so I recommend having clients on the left and features on the top. If there are too many features, break it up into multiple tables. This is how Wikipedia usually does "Comparison of *x*" articles.

## Ordering

I don't like using alphabetization here because it can be easily gamed. How about ordering by popularity using user-agent stats, and resolving ties using maturity? [theymos](User:Theymos) ([[talk|User_talk:Theymos]]) 02:05, 10 July 2012 (GMT)
