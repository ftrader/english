I think what would be nice:

* offline wallet support *via GUI* (like Armory), so that I can do my BTC transfers via an offline PC running Electrum, and USB stick and an online PC running Electrum, where my private keys are only on my offline PC.
* import/backup of (non-deterministic) keys via GUI [[!template id=unsigned Michael S 10:51, 4 August 2012â€Ž]]
