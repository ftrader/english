Open Point: It is _not clear_ whether the algorithm of deterministic address generation is designed such that for any two seeds "S1" and "S2" (out of the 2^128 possible different seeds) the following condition holds true:

* If 4.3 Billion (2^32 to be exact) new addresses are calculated from each S1 and from S2, does the algorithm guarantee that there will be no collision between the set of 2^32 addresses from S1 and the set of 2^32 addresses from S2?
If this condition does not hold true, it needs to be clarified whether the use of deterministic wallets still bares an acceptably low probability of address collisions.
