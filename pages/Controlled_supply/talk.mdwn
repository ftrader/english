Perhaps it's useful to display the expected monetary inflation rate in each year:

	52500 x 50.0 =100.0% 2009
	52500 x 50.0 = 50.0% 2010
	52500 x 50.0 = 33.3% 2011
	52500 x 50.0 = 25.0% 2012
	52500 x 25.0 = 11.1% 2013
	52500 x 25.0 = 10.0% 2014
	52500 x 25.0 =  9.1% 2015
	52500 x 25.0 =  8.3% 2016
	52500 x 12.5 =  4.0% 2017
	52500 x 12.5 =  3.8% 2018
	52500 x 12.5 =  3.7% 2019
	52500 x 12.5 =  3.6% 2020
