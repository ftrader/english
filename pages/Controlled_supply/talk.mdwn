Please see my points over at [[File_talk:Total_bitcoins_over_time_graph.png]] which describe why I deleted the graph, and description of a suitable alternative. Seriously, the amount of misleading information that prior graph has disseminated into the public is horrorshow-enormous.

Note that the actual supply is different than what is listed on these graphs due to provably destroyed coins, duplicate coinbase, and underpays; this should be accounted-for in the graphs. [Midnightmagic](User:Midnightmagic) ([[talk|User_talk:Midnightmagic]]) 16:32, 16 September 2014 (UTC)
