##Insurance

Coinbase is insured against employee theft and hacking in an amount that exceeds the average value of online bitcoin it holds at any given time. Specifically, Coinbase's insurance policy would respond in the event that bitcoin stored in Coinbase was lost or stolen as a result of a breach of our physical security, cyber security, or as a result of employee theft.

Coinbase has held this insurance since November 2013 with highly rated carriers (S&P rating of A+ or A.M. Best Rating of A XV or higher).

This insurance policy does not cover damages resulting from a specific user's loss, such as the losses resulting from a compromise of the user's login credentials. Coinbase's insurance also contains standard policy exclusions (e.x. [force majeure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force_majeure)). Should information regarding this coverage materially change, weâ€™ll update this and other relevant pages in a timely manner.
