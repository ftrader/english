Does the PHP section's gmp/bcmath discussion better fit on the proper money handling page?

I also disagree with the statement "you MUST use gmp/bcmath" -- as long as your php implementation uses 64-bit floats (and all that I know of do), doing bitcoin calculations with them will work just fine, as long as you are careful to round to 8 decimal places when displaying values to the user or storing final amounts in a database.
