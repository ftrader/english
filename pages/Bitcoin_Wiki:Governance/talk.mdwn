A personal request - please discuss this over at [this bitcointalk thread](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=157857.0) instead of over here.
I just hate mediawiki discussions, and I still haven't figured out how to get email alerts when someone replies to me, so I'll probably never see your message if you add it here, as opposed to bitcointalk.

As I explained on the Bitcoin talk thread, I don't think this page is a good idea. --[Gmaxwell](User:Gmaxwell) ([[talk|User_talk:Gmaxwell]]) 20:06, 29 March 2013 (GMT)

>  Gmaxwell, [I have replied](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=157857.msg1671863#msg1671863) to your bitcointalk post a while back. I do believe that some core rules are required ... hopefully we never need to enforce them. Do you disagree with any of the rules proposed here? (Please take the answer to the bitcointalk thread).
