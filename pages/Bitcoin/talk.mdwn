Why not make this page a copy of [the wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin)?

This page is a little funny, given that the whole wiki is about Bitcoin. I thought I'd just keep it a short page, for the person who doesn't like to spend time reading long paragraphs. This is like the Main_Page. Not much text there either. Just links. --[Prcarter](User:Prcarter) 03:28, 3 March 2011 (GMT)
