The Bitcoin Bulletin is a resource focused on increasing Trader exposure.

I will be doing weekly interviews with traders from the Wiki's Trade Page.

The first interview has already been lined up with Nylira, a Bitcoin-accepting website design firm.

Most interviews will be scheduled via my Twitter Account @BitcoinBulletin.

The Bitcoin Bulletin was started on 03-03-2011
