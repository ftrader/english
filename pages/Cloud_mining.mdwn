**Cloud Mining** is the process of mining utilizing a remote datacenter with shared processing power often contracted through a Cloud Mining company. This type of mining allows users to mine Bitcoins without having to manage their own hardware. Since Cloud Mining is provided as a service there is generally some cost, and this can result in lower returns for the miner. 

##Types of Hosting

Users of hosted Mining equipment can either lease a physical mining server or a Virtual private server and install mining software on the machine. Instead of leasing a dedicated server, some services offer hashing power hosted in data centers for sale denominated in Gigahash/seconds (GH/s). Users either select a desired amount of hashing power and a period for the contract or in some cases can trade their hashing power.
