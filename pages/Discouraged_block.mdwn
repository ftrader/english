The idea of "discouraging" a block is to not mine on top of that block, instead mining on top of some other block in an attempt to orphan the discouraged block. Bitcoin does not currently implement block discouraging in any form.

Block discouragement is discussed in a forum post, ["Feather-forks: enforcing a blacklist with sub-50% hash power"](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=312668.0), although the idea predates this.
