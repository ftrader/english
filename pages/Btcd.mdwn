btcd is a full-node implementation in Google Go by Conformal.  Its [project page on GitHub](https://github.com/conformal/btcd) says:

"It currently properly downloads, validates, and serves the block chain using the exact rules (including bugs) for block acceptance as the reference implementation (bitcoind).  [[...]]  btcd does NOT include wallet functionality and this was a very intentional design decision."

See also the <tt>btcd</tt> tag on [Conformal's blog](https://blog.conformal.com/tag/btcd/), especially the ["ready for public testing" announcement](https://blog.conformal.com/btcd-not-your-moms-bitcoin-daemon/).

Because BTCD uses an alternative consensus implementation, it is vulnerable to breaking consensus and fake confirmation attacks.
