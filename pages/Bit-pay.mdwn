Bit-pay is an automated payment processing system for the bitcoin currency. It enables online merchants to accept bitcoins, as a form of payment, just as easily they accept payments from credit cards, debit cards, or Paypal.   For the similarly-named mobile wallet application, see [[BitPay]].

##Merchant Tools
For merchants that already have a shopping cart, bit-pay's Hosted Checkout can allow shoppers to pay for their order using bitcoins.  
For merchants that only have a catalog of items, bit-pay can provide buttons and widgets for merchants to place by their items, which will add them to a shopping cart at bit-pay.  

##Fees
The automated solution and shopping cart is available for all merchants for a fee of 0.99% of the value of the sale.
If the merchant wants to receive a currency other than bitcoins, (e.g. US Dollars) bit-pay can trade the coins for dollars, and send a direct deposit to the merchant's bank account.  Merchants have no currency risk of bitcoins at all.  The fee for this service is 2.99% of the value of the sale.
