The **Church of Bitcoin** was founded on October 25th 2012 in order to grant Bitcoin users a non regional spiritual outlet and to escape oppression by existing religious groups. Its homepage may be at [bitprayer.com](http://bitprayer.com/)

The Church of Bitcoin is guided by eleven commandments:

1. Praise Satoshi.
1. Honor the blockchain.
1. Thou shalt not fork thine own family.
1. Keep the network holy.
1. Thou should not covet another man's wallet.
1. Do unto others as you would have them DDoS you.
1. Thou shalt not swear unto another man that thine payment hath not been received until all of the blockchain hath been downloadeth.
1. Salt thine passwords.
1. Hack thine planet.
1. Keep thine woman, [Bruces](https://twitter.com/brucewagner) and [Atlases](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=98695) in separate camps if they are unclean.
1. Troll harder.
