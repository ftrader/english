The point of Bitcoin is that it is a decentralized peer to peer currency. 
That is the novelty about Bitcoin; the novelty is NOT that it comes along with a funky new way of counting things.
So please stop using Bitcoin to promote your own agenda ; this is just going to confuse people.
If you want to introduce a new method for counting currency, I suggest you go talk to the FED and propose the Tonal Dollar, or whatever.
