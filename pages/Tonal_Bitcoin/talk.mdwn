This is for discussion, not trolling. Note that this is not an encyclopedia, and does not have any "notability" requirements. If you don't want to use Tonal, don't. Trolling is not acceptable and will be deleted. Reasoned criticism is welcome in the "Criticism" section of the page.


I have no legitimate stake in the matter, I made a few edits that I hope remove POV and still embrace the idea of Tonal Bitcoin. This is Raize, I am sorry I am not familiar enough with wiki editing to provide my signature. --[Raize](User:Raize)

This page should be deleted until there is a working, supported, maintained Tonal Bitcoin client. Vaporware doesn't belong on this wiki, you'll get articles on CosbyCoin and UnicornCoin...
