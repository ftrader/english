The point of Bitcoin is that it is a decentralized peer to peer currency. 
That is the novelty about Bitcoin; the novelty is NOT that it comes along with a funky new way of counting things.
So please stop using Bitcoin to promote your own agenda ; this is just going to confuse people.
If you want to introduce a new method for counting currency, I suggest you go talk to the FED and propose the Tonal Dollar, or whatever.

* If Bitcoin has only one purpose, then it will never succeed. There are about as many people that care about a "decentralized peer to peer currency" as there are that care about Tonal. If you want BitCoin to succeed, you should support as many (legal) reasons to use it as possible. Also, whether it's ever enforced or not, vandalism and trolling should be bannable offenses. --[Luke-jr](User:Luke-jr) 04:43, 21 February 2011 (GMT)

This page should be deleted.
Nothing against Tonal, if there was a Hexadecimal Bitcoin or an Octal Bitcoin I would suggest those get deleted, too.

* Seconded. Tonal is not a key part of bitcoin, and currently not used in any form. If there is a reasonable number of users using tonal, then I would have no objections against this page. [Mqrius](User:Mqrius) 05:11, 2 February 2012 (GMT)

This is silly. I thought you'd removed this already, but it's seeping across to other pages despite me never seeing it in the wild. It serves only to confuse [Gigitrix](User:Gigitrix) 01:41, 13 June 2011 (GMT)

I agree with Gavin that this page should be deleted. Regardless of my personal opinion or the technical merits of tonal v. decimal, it's fair to say that tonal attracts scorn and ridicule from the vast majority of the population if they hear about it. Bitcoin's reputation suffers from the association. [ByteCoin](User:ByteCoin) 24 June 2011 (GMT)

* It's not fair to say that, no. --[Luke-jr](User:Luke-jr) 00:45, 25 June 2011 (GMT)
