This page aims to be the best resource for new users to understand how to buy Bitcoins.
The existing [[Buying_bitcoins]] page is too complex, and not transparent enough for new investors.
Be extremely careful when buying bitcoins from not accredited websites or individuals. Like in the real world there are many scammers around.

## Intro
[You can't reliably buy Bitcoins using PayPal or credit cards](http://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/2293/how-can-i-buy-bitcoin-via-a-credit-card-or-paypal), because it is risky for the seller, and therefore few sellers will offer this. There are basically 4 reasons for that:

* The TOS of PayPal actually prohibit buying digital currency with it
* The buyer of bitcoins can always perform a chargeback and there is no way for the seller to contest that
* There are many hacked accounts and when PayPal realizes that such an account has been fraudulently used, they will also perform a chargeback
* PayPal doesn't like bitcoin, as the bitcoin network is in direct competition to it


### Anonymity
There is a HUGE demand for buying bitcoins off the grid due to ever-increasing government regulations and private agency intrusions and discrimination against alternative currencies. 
Due to the possibility of facial recognition cameras at banks and the paper trail involved with credit cards, there are very few options to have high levels of anonymity when buying bitcoins those ways. DNA, Fingerprints, phone and internet records, audio and video records will not be discussed, but they all are possible tools which attackers could use to uncloak even the stealthiest bitcoin buyer.
There are a couple known ways, depending on your location, to buy bitcoins outside of the standard banking system with relatively high anonymity.
Buying locally with cash using a burner or payphone allows a high level of anonymity with the exchange being the weakest link.
Many sellers online will also trade bitcoins for [[MoneyPak]] codes or other cash-like gift codes which can be bought at a local store with cash.
Another way to buy bitcoins with a high level of anonymity is by sending cash in the mail. 

### Cash (International)

### Via Money Transfer

### Finding a direct seller online
If you can find another person that is willing to sell them to you, you can transfer him money via whatever method (including PayPal), and he'll send you the Bitcoins. The following websites can be used to find direct sellers online  [[Bitcoin_OTC]], [Bitcoinary](https://www.bitcoinary.com/) or the [Currency Exchange Forum Section](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=53.0). Be extremely cautious when using those methods, the best way is to ask an admin, moderator or a trusted person. Bitcoins are now also available at [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00CPCHACM). The seller only sells in low volumes so far, but it is a great way to turn amazon gift cards into bitcoin with no hassle, and probably one of the first ways to obtain bitcoin with a debit card or credit card.

### Instant bank transfers within the EU and UK
