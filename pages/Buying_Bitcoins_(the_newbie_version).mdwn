This page aims to be the best resource for new users to understand how to buy Bitcoins.
The existing [[Buying_bitcoins]] page is too complex, and not transparent enough for new investors.
Be extremely careful when buying bitcoins from not accredited websites or individuals. Like in the real world there are many scammers around.

## Intro
[You can't reliably buy Bitcoins using PayPal or credit cards](http://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/2293/how-can-i-buy-bitcoin-via-a-credit-card-or-paypal), because it is risky for the seller, and therefore few sellers will offer this. There are basically 4 reasons for that:

* The TOS of PayPal actually prohibit buying digital currency with it
* The buyer of bitcoins can always perform a chargeback and there is no way for the seller to contest that
* There are many hacked accounts and when PayPal realizes that such an account has been fraudulently used, they will also perform a chargeback
* PayPal doesn't like bitcoin, as the bitcoin network is in direct competition to it

There are several ways, depending on your location. Many sellers online will trade bitcoins for moneypak codes. See http://www.moneypak.com/

* The only way to buy bitcoins COMPLETELY anonymously is by mailing in cash. There are camera's equipped with facial recognition at every bank, and credit cards may be traced.

### Finding a direct seller online
If you can find another person that is willing to sell them to you, you can transfer him money via whatever method (including PayPal), and he'll send you the Bitcoins. The following websites can be used to find direct sellers online  [[Bitcoin_OTC]], [Bitcoinary](https://www.bitcoinary.com/) or the [Currency Exchange Forum Section](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=53.0). Be extremely cautious when using those methods, the best way is to ask an admin, moderator or a trusted person. Bitcoins are now also available at [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00CPCHACM). The seller only sells in low volumes so far, but it is a great way to turn amazon gift cards into bitcoin with no hassle, and probably one of the first ways to obtain bitcoin with a debit card or credit card.
