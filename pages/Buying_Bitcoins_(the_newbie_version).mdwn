This page aims to be the best resource for new users to understand how to buy Bitcoins.
The existing [[Buying_bitcoins]] page is too complex, and not noob-friendly.

## Intro
[You can't reliably buy Bitcoins using PayPal or credit cards](http://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/2293/how-can-i-buy-bitcoin-via-a-credit-card-or-paypal), because it is risky for the seller, and therefore few sellers will offer this. There are several ways, depending on your location. Many sellers online will trade bitcoins for moneypak codes. See http://www.moneypak.com/

### Finding a direct seller
If you can find another person that is willing to sell them to you, you can transfer him money via whatever method (including PayPal), and he'll send you the Bitcoins. One place to look for people willing to sell is [[Bitcoin_OTC]]. Some good websites for people to connect locally for bitcoin trade are  http://localbitcoins.com/  and  https://www.bitcoinary.com/

Many Bitcoin users will accept cash in the mail for small amounts of Bitcoin.

### Physical locations
Depending on your country, you might be able to [simply walk into a store and buy them in a retail setting (Cash/credit card)](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=83209.0;all).

### Exchanges / Bitinstant
You can buy Bitcoins via [[an Exchange|Buying_bitcoins#Major_Exchanges]] or [[BitInstant]].

Here is a video tutorial explaining BitInstant: http://vimeo.com/44849463
