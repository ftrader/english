BitLendingClub is a peer-to-peer Bitcoin lending platform. They help borrowers get Bitcoin loans online for the lowest rates and the lowest transaction fees. BLC, for short, relies on the free market and group wisdom to provide the most competitive interest rates. The lenders compete in a dutch auction style in order to assess the risk of each loan and offer the lowest possible rate for a given borrower. BitLendingClub boasts some of lowest fees in the industry at 1% of the loan value. The lending fees are paid by the borrower as part of the loan payments, which means that BLC does not make a commission on default loans. Furthermore, ther are no withdrawal fees, aside from the recommended BTC tip (roughly 0.0001 BTC). In essence, BLC only gets their commission when the borrower pays back the loan.
