−*** There are reports of dishonest practices at icbit.***−

-Accusations include: 

**a)** prices of futures contracts on icbit are deliberately manipulated, 

**b)** contract prices do not trade purely based on bitcoin price movements and speculative pressures but largely on manipulations unrelated to bitcoin price and 

**c)** website management encourages these manipulations, allowing larger traders to effectively strip funds from smaller traders. 

At least three traders with knowledge of derivatives have pointed out what appear to be deliberately corrupt practices on the website.

-Icbit did return a substantial amount of bitcoin to one experienced trader who made a detailed webpage describing corrupt practices. http://trilema.com/2012/icbitse-the-bucket-shop/ 

This wiki page edit is by a second trader with experience in derivatives who quit the site after noticing dishonest practices and who then requested a refund. The practices that justify a refund are detailed with screenshots and detailed explanations at https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=246845

−**Please do not invest any money at icbit until you understand the issues raised in the complaints and/or the corrupt practices have been changed.** 

−The owner of icbit has so far refused to answer complaints publicly. 

-Traders would also be advised to review discussion and edit notes for this wiki page to see how the owner of icbit operates.− (1.1)  (1.2)  (1.3)

ICBIT is a trading website which runs a few markets. Both the Exchange and Futures markets are live now.

This site is said<sup>[[source?]]</sup> to be founded by Fireball and [[DeepBit]] by combining best practices in high-performance trading and Bitcoin experience.

**ICBIT is not an exchange** since it does not act as a central counterparty. [According to their website](http://web.archive.org/web/20130510221928/https://icbit.se/margincall) users **are totally exposed to counterparty risk from other traders** whose identities are concealed from them; the exchange does not pledge its own assets to back the full extent of the other side of a customer's position -- it pledges only "as much to profiting traders as loosing traders lost (in total)".  Traders are not allowed to conduct background or reputation checks of any kind on these anonymous counterparties.  ICBIT recently modified the linked page and it **now contains self-contradictory information,** such as "we do pledge our own assets, it's not always the case" and "your profitable position will be closed" at whatever price the exchange deems convenient rather than value-at-maturity.  Since the exchange pledges only "as much to profiting traders as loosing traders lost (in total)" it is, by definition, not the [counterparty](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counterparty) -- the "loosing [[sic]] traders" are the counterparty.

## Features
For its currency exchange section ICBIT makes an accent on the following:

* State-of-the-art technologies usage. Instead of using old, slow, polling-based algorithms ICBIT builds atop of the most up to date technologies. Its web trading client is in pure HTML and JavaScript (even compatible with most mobile devices), however it's fully realtime thanks to websockets and AJAX.
* Speed of trading. Bitcoin forum is full of anger against slowness of existing exchanges. ICBIT implements special high performance trading engine and uses high-performance "no SQL" database to eliminate the problem.
* No limits. Most of the existing exchanges put rather restrictive limitations and require users to prove their identity. ICBIT finds this totally unacceptable and does not put any limits at all.
