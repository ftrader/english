##History

The site was first announced on July 17, 2011 (16.1) with test mode trading.  Live trading began on August 7, 2011 (16.2).

On July 31, 2012 the service reported a security incident in which halted trading and caused financial loss to the exchange.  The exchange says it covered losses from reserves and trading resumed in a matter of hours (16.3).

On August 2, 2012 the service added an API for trading, but still lacks an API for bitcoin withdrawals (something offered by every major exchange).  On August 20, 2012 the service added BTC/RUR and USD/RUR trading markets.  On September 3, 2012 the service added numerous RUR deposit and withdawal methods as well as more USD deposit and withdrawal methods (16.4).
