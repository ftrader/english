I'm a little confused.  When I see software, I'm assuming this is something I can install and run.  MyBitcoin is not something I can install and run.  - [Sgornick](User:Sgornick) 19:30, 18 July 2011 (GMT)

## Where to place Bitcoin-Qt?

I found out that there is problem where Bitcoin-qt should be placed. Frontends isn't good category, because Bitcoin-Qt don't need bitcoind core to work (it have core build in). It should be rather in Clients category, with addition that it is future Bitcoin GUI, so all should looks like that:

Bitcoin clients:

* [[Bitcoin client|Original_Bitcoin_client]] - standard Bitcoin client, recommended for installation
* [[Bitcoin-qt]] - Future Bitcoin GUI based on C++ and Qt, tabbed UI, full-featured, Linux/MacOSX/Windows, but still experimental (if you don't know, don't use it)
* [[bitcoind]] - GUI-less version of the standard Bitcoin client, providing [[JSON-RPC|API_reference_(JSON-RPC)]] interface (see also -server option of the standard client)
