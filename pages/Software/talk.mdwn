There doesn't seem to be much a convention in terms of order of software listings. I'd propose alphabetically but I think it might be better to go by some estimate of installed user base since new users are likely to start at the top.

I'm a little confused.  When I see software, I'm assuming this is something I can install and run.  MyBitcoin is not something I can install and run.  - [Sgornick](User:Sgornick) 19:30, 18 July 2011 (GMT)

## Where to place Bitcoin-Qt?

I found out that there is problem where Bitcoin-qt should be placed. Frontends isn't good category, because Bitcoin-Qt don't need bitcoind core to work (it have core build in). It should be rather in Clients category, with addition that it is future Bitcoin GUI, so all should looks like that:

Bitcoin clients:

* [[Bitcoin client|Original_Bitcoin_client]] - standard Bitcoin client, recommended for installation
* [[Bitcoin-qt]] - Future Bitcoin GUI based on C++ and Qt, tabbed UI, full-featured, Linux/MacOSX/Windows, but still experimental (if you don't know, don't use it)
* [[bitcoind]] - GUI-less version of the standard Bitcoin client, providing [[JSON-RPC|API_reference_(JSON-RPC)]] interface (see also -server option of the standard client)
