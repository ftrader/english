An installation wrapper for a modified Bitcoind CPU miner.  This software will run the miner at a level such that use of the computer can continue without impact from having the CPU miner running at the same time.

A scenario where this software might be useful is to have the system in a computer lab use idle time for mining.

This software was announced on April 17, 2011 (1.1).

##Criticism

If the name Stealthcoin doesn't describe another use for this software, consider an alternate name: "Bitcoin - Botnet Edition".

Kaspersky Internet Security 11.0.1.400 identifies the editor.exe as beeing infected with Trojan.Win32.Scar.dzmz.
