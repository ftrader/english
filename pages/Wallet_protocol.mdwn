This is a project to define a new wallet protocol addressing problems with the current JSON-RPC implementation in bitcoind.
Please feel free to make edits. If you disagree with something, turn it into a "debate".

## Requirements

* Never use human-formatted data (for example, use base bitcoin units, not Decimal BitCoins nor Tonal BitCoins, which be left to the GUI)
* Don't require polling (for example, broadcast events for new transactions, or changes to current "work")

### Debates
#### Binary or plaintext

* Binary is more efficient to parse and create
* Plaintext is easier for humans to debug
