## ABCPool.co

ABCPool.co has some appealing advantages that are hard to find anywhere else in the same combination:

* Predictable Income: Pay-per-Share means you know how much you get.
* We pay for Stale Shares: up to 3% extra income; because we think a pool should be responsible for delivering new work to you in time!
* Immediate payouts: no more waiting for ‘estimated/unconfirmed reward’ to become available!
* Come & Go as you like: Pay-per-Share is immune to pool hopping

Of course you’ll also find the common features at ABCPool.co:

* Long Polling support
* No penalty for invalid blocks
* Automatic payout
* Easy sign-up


A bit of background: As creators of ABCPool, we have always had a preference for PPS mining. We’d noticed for some time that there was a distinct lack of Pay-per-Share mining pools. That's why we decided to fill that gap in the Bitcoin community by introducing ABCPool.co. 

During the introduction weeks ABCPool.co will only take a 2% fee (NB: Other pools currently charge 10%).
