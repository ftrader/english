ZTEX is a manufacturer of FPGA boards. ZTEX offers the 
[USB-FPGA Module 1.15x](http://www.ztex.de/usb-fpga-1/usb-fpga-1.15x.e.html)
which is optimized for cryptographic computations like Bitcoin Mining. 

This FPGA Board has on-board voltage regulators and an USB interface which is used for
communication and device programming. Low cost
FPGA mining rigs can be build using standard components (USB hubs, USB cables, ATX PSU's).

With the current version of the [[BTCMiner]] this FPGA Board achieves typically 200 MH/s (most FPGA boards run with 200 MHz without errors or at a very low error rate, a few FPGA boards even achieve 208 MHz). Power dissipation is 8.8 W at 200 Mhz.

Current prices including volume prices are stated at the [Bitcoin Forum](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=49180).
