FoxyCart provides a hosted e-commerce platform built for integration into existing systems. FoxyCart’s service is not turnkey or “all in one”, but rather is built for web professionals who already have their own best-of-breed systems. FoxyCart can serve as a foundation for advanced custom e-commerce deployments, or for quick and easy single-product online stores.

##History
