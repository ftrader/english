BitcoinSpinner is a light-weight, secure and user friendly Bitcoin wallet for Android.
Feature Overview:

* Send and receive Bitcoins using QR codes
* Share your Bitcoin address using Gmail, Twitter and more.
* Backup/restore wallet using QR codes.

BitcoinSpinner is NOT an on-line Bitcoin Bank. Nobody can run away with your Bitcoins.
