Stratum is a proposal for an open source client-server "overlay" protocol that enables thin clients.
It is currently used by [[Electrum]].
While originally announced right before 2012 (1.1), the protocol has not yet been completed and proposed as a [[BIP]] for standardisation.

##Mining extensions

The stratum protocol was extended to support pooled mining as a replacement for obsolete [[getwork|Getwork]] protocol in late 2012.
Developed behind closed doors, the mining service specification was initially announced via [[Slushs_pool]]'s website (2.1).
Shortly thereafter, alternative "cheat sheet" style documentation was provided by [[BTCGuild]] (2.2).
As the extension lacks a formal [[BIP]] describing an official standard, it has further developed only by discussion and implementation (2.3).
