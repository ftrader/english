Stratum is a proposal for an open source client-server "overlay" protocol that enables thin clients.
It is currently used by [[Electrum]].
While originally announced right before 2012 (1.1), the protocol has not yet been completed and proposed as a [[BIP]] for standardisation.

##Mining extensions

The stratum protocol was extended to support pooled mining as a replacement for obsolete [[getwork|Getwork]] protocol in late 2012.
The mining service specification was initially announced via [[Slushs_pool]]'s website (2.1).
Shortly thereafter, alternative "cheat sheet" style documentation was provided by [[BTCGuild]] (2.2).
As the extension lacks a formal [[BIP]] describing an official standard, it has further developed only by discussion and implementation (2.3).

###Criticism

####Closed development

The mining extensions have been criticised as having been developed behind closed doors without input from the wider development and mining community, resulting in various obvious problems that could have been addressed had it followed the standard [[BIP]] drafting process (6.1).

####Displacing GBT

The mining extensions were announced after the community had spent months developing a mostly superior open standard protocol for mining ([[getblocktemplate]]) (7.1).
Because stratum's mining extensions launched backed by a major mining pool, GBT adoption suffered, and decentralised mining is often neglected while stratum is deployed.
