The Stratum protocol is used for pooled mining as a replacement for the obsolete [[getwork|Getwork]] protocol. The details of the specification, as provided in many places, have be gathered here: [Stratum protocol documentation](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=557866.0) The original mining service specification was available on [Slush's pool website](http://mining.bitcoin.cz/stratum-mining/).  Other examples are available on [BTC Guild's website](https://www.btcguild.com/new_protocol.php). See also [on the forums](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=55842.0) and [the official site](http://blog.bitcoin.cz/stratum).
Stratum is also a proposal for an open source client-server "Overlay" protocol that enables thin clients (currently used by Electrum client).
