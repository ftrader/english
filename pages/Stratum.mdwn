Stratum is a proposal for an open source client-server "Overlay" protocol that enables thin clients.

Stratum protocol may be also used for mining as a replacement for obsolete [[getwork|Getwork]] protocol. Full mining service specification is available on [Slush's pool website](http://mining.bitcoin.cz/stratum-mining/).
