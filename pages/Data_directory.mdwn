The location where Bitcoin's data files are stored, including the [[wallet|Wallet]] data file.

##Default Location
### Windows

Go to Start -> Run (or press WinKey+R) and run this:

	explorer %APPDATA%\Bitcoin

Bitcoin's data folder will open. For most users, this is the following locations:

	C:\Documents and Settings\YourUserName\Application data\Bitcoin (XP)
	
	C:\Users\YourUserName\Appdata\Roaming\Bitcoin (Vista and 7)

"AppData" and "Application data" are hidden by default.

### Linux

By default Bitcoin will put its data here:

	~/.bitcoin/

You need to do a "ls -a" to see directories that start with a dot.

If that's not it, you can do a search like this:

	find / -name wallet.dat -print 2>/dev/null

### Mac

By default Bitcoin will put its data here:

	~/Library/Application Support/Bitcoin/
