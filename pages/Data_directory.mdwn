The location where Bitcoin's data files are stored, including the [[wallet|Wallet]] data file.

##Default Location
### Windows

Go to Start -> Run (or press WinKey+R) and run this:

	explorer %APPDATA%\Bitcoin

Bitcoin's data folder will open. For most users, this is the following locations:

	C:\Documents and Settings\YourUserName\Application data\Bitcoin (XP)
	
	C:\Users\YourUserName\Appdata\Roaming\Bitcoin (Vista and 7)

"AppData" and "Application data" are hidden by default.

You can also store Bitcoin data files in any other drive or folder. 

If you have already downloaded the data then you will have to move the data to the new folder.
If you want to store them in D:\BitcoinData then click on "Properties" of Bitcoin.exe
add -datadir=d:\BitCoinData at the end as an example:

	"C:\Program Files (x86)\Bitcoin\bitcoin-qt.exe" -datadir=d:\BitCoinData

Start Bitcoin, now you will see all the files are created in the new data directory.

### Linux

By default Bitcoin will put its data here:

	~/.bitcoin/

You need to do a "ls -a" to see directories that start with a dot.

If that's not it, you can do a search like this:

	find / -name wallet.dat -print 2>/dev/null

### Mac

By default Bitcoin will put its data here:

	~/Library/Application Support/Bitcoin/
