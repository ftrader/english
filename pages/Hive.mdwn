By February 3, 2014, the mac OS X wallet has come out of beta testing and was available to public through download on its website.  (3.3) After a few months, Hive Android was launched for Beta testing.  (3.4) Hive Web was officially launched during the Inside Bitcoins Conference HK last June 24-25, 2014.  (3.5) Hive universal iOS wallet (3.6) was also recently launched last August 13 and is available in the App store.

On September 20, 2015, it was announced by Hive Wallet Founder, Wendell Davis, that the wallet is officially unsupported and he recommends to use something else, until new maintainers are found. (3.7) (3.8) He claims that the wallet actually does work fine and the servers will kept online for anyone who needs them. (3.9)
