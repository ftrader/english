"Minerscube" claimed to be producing 20nm mining hardware.
However, interested observers have noticed that the company's address does not seem to exist, and that there is no such company registered with the State of New York.
In addition, its information on this wiki came from someone who repeatedly tries to censor these above observations, as well as ignoring attempts of dispute resolution, which resulted in their being banned.
Rather than attempt to discuss the reasons for the ban and have it removed, they then proceeded to evade the ban using a new account, and edit Minerscube pages/claims again without making any argument for their legitimacy.

Therefore, it is *likely* that Minerscube is a scam. Beware.
