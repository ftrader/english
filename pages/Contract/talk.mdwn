**Example 3: Securing Bets**

How would you use contracts to place bets in a poker game? Specifically, could you form a separate contract for each person who calls a bet and automatically allocate funds to the winner?


*In theory section:*

When SIGHASH_ALL performed, pubkey exists in scriptSig too?

	script.cpp +1046:
	
	// Blank out other inputs' signatures
	for (int i = 0; i < txTmp.vin.size(); i++)
	txTmp.vin[[i]].scriptSig = CScript();
	txTmp.vin[[nIn]].scriptSig = scriptCode;
