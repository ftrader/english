A community site that provides bitcoin expert contacts for the global press and media.

Launched by Andreas Antonopoulos as a sensible reaction to the bitter infighting regarding potential press contacts within the community, this resource supports multiple languages and time zones as well as targeted searches of individuals that have expressed a willingness to be available for media interviews. 

Nominations for Bitcoin experts accepted with the only criteria being accuracy of their stated credentials and confirmation that they want to be listed.
