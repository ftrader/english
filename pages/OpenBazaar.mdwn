**OpenBazaar**, formerly known as **DarkMarket**, is an [[open_source]] [[decentralized|Decentralization]] online marketplace designed for [[e-commerce]], using the [[cryptocurrency]] [[bitcoin]].

## History
Programmer and [[bitcoin]] enthusiast [[Amir_Taaki]] and a team of other developers created the prototype of a decentralized marketplace, entitled "DarkMarket", in April 2014 at a Toronto Bitcoin Hackathon. (2.1) DarkMarket was developed as a [[proof_of_concept]] in response to the seizure of the [[online marketplace|Darknet_market]] [[Silk Road|Silk_Road_(marketplace)]] in October 2013. Taaki compared DarkMarket's improvements on Silk Road to [[BitTorrent]]'s improvements on [[Napster]].

Soon after DarkMarket was revealed at the hackathon, developer Brian Hoffman forked the project and renamed it "OpenBazaar", which continues to receive active development as of June 2015. (2.2) OpenBazaar, like DarkMarket before it, was initially licensed under the [[GNU AGPLv3|Affero_General_Public_License]], but after a discussion by the developers it was relicensed under the [[MIT license|MIT_License]] on September 8, 2014. (2.3)
