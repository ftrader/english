Xapo is a Switzerland-based company that provides a bitcoin wallet combined with a cold storage vault and a bitcoin-based debit card. Xapo CEO and entrepreneur Wences Casares became interested in bitcoins because of the frequent financial fluctuations in his native Argentina.

Xapo announced $20 million Series A funding in March 2014. The funding round was led by [[Benchmark|Benchmark_(venture_capital_firm)]], with participation from [[Fortress_Investment_Group]], [[Pantera_Capital]], and Ribbit Capital. Benchmark partner [[Matt_Cohler]] said the VC firm backed Xapo in part because Xapo “is led by one of the most important people in the bitcoin ecosystem, it’s insured and has investors from both [[Silicon_Valley]] and [[Wall_Street]].”

The company has raised a total of $40 million as of August 2014.
