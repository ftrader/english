##Payment
Prior to the auction, the FBI transferred 144,341.52494935 BTC to the US Marshals in one output of 100,000 BTC and the rest in another output. The reason for including two separate outputs rather than just one is not apparent. After the auction, the coins from output A were broken into nine outputs of approximately 5,000 BTC each, an output of 3,000 BTC, and an output of 52,000 BTC. The coins from the smaller output B currently reside in an output for the address 1CaGxqCQv2ofqLf37HCUQoLujzRMaz74LK, likely reserved for a future auction. The journey made by the coins from the original address to their current destinations have left a mysterious trail of 0.05 BTC outputs.

The 5,000 BTC outputs were all recombined into 10,000 BTC outputs. Additionally, the 52,000 BTC had 2,000 BTC removed, possibly for one of the auction blocks (as this would make the remaining 50,000 BTC exactly half of the original 100,000).
