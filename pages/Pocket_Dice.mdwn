Pocket Dice is the first realistic BTC dice game.

## History
Pocket Dice was first released on July 21, 2014, with the start of BitcoinTalk thread. (2.1)
## Original design
One of the main original and unique features of this game is a realistic design with lifelike dice.
PocketDice abandoned the usual concept of bitcoin dice games and stripped it down to the comprehensive level of real life dice.
## Simplicity
The idea of realistic design made the initial rules easier as well. User just have to choose his bet, over or under the one of the numbers a person can get by throwing two dice, then choose his bet amount and throw the dice.
## Provably fair
PocketDice is Provably Fair. (5.1) What that means is that there is no way the site can cheat you by picking numbers to make you lose.

To achieve Provably Fair Gaming we utilise strong cryptographic algorithms such as SHA256, Mersenne Twister and Fisher-Yates shuffle. These ensure the game cannot be tampered with.
