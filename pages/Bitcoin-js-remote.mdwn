##Apache HTTPD Configuration for Bitcoin JS Remote
[am assuming a little knowledge about Apache httpd. You had better read on Apache httpd directives: http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/directives.html](I)

Assuming your bitcoin.conf file includes:
rpcuser=myuser
rpcpassword=mypass

First, generate a suitable file for Basic Authentification. See man htpasswd or execute
	htpasswd -b -c my_prefer_filename myuser mypass

Set following Apache directives in the proper context, i.e. server or virtual host configuration:

<Proxy http://127.0.0.1:8332>
	AuthType Basic
	AuthName "Bitcoin Access"
	AuthUserFile my_prefer_filename
	Require user myuser
	Order deny,allow
	Allow from all
</Proxy>

1. Assuming you want to access Bitcoin JS Remote with http://mydomain/jbc
	Alias /jbc pathabs_to_bitcoin-js-remote
	ProxyPass /lbc/ http://127.0.0.1:8332/
	ProxyPassReverse /lbc/ http://127.0.0.1:8332/

User and Password will be required when accessing with http://mydomain/jbc. Then, set Bitcoind's URL to the desired path: in the above example will be “/lbc/” or by default will be “/”.

Alternatively, create a “settings.json” file in the bitcoin-js-remote directory: (see proper syntax in the settings.json_sample):
	RPC.url : /lbc/
	RPC.user : myuser
	RPC.password : mypass

That's all. Restart your Apache web server.

Other interesting Apache directives:

1. To redirect all HTTP to HTTPS (of course, you need a well-configured ssl site).
1. !!! SSL access is extremely recommended to protect your Bitcoin data.
	RewriteCond %{HTTPS} off
	RewriteRule (.*) https://%{HTTP_HOST}%{REQUEST_URI}

		1. To avoid your log file from flooding
	SetEnvIf Request_URI "^/jbc/" dontlog
	SetEnvIf Request_URI "^/lbc/" dontlog
	CustomLog myfile.log combined env=!dontlog

Finally, if you go in trouble, check proper access to bitcoin daemon with curl:
curl \
--trace-time \
--trace-ascii - \
--data-binary \
'{"jsonrpc": "1.0", "id":"curltest", "method": "getinfo", "params": [] }' \
--header 'content-type: text/plain;' \
http://myuser:mypass@127.0.0.1:8332/
