This article describes the governance of this wiki.

# History
## Current state
Currently (March 2013), the wiki is effectively without government. There is a set of five [users with admin](https://en.bitcoin.it/w/index.php?title=Special:ListUsers&group=sysop) rights:

* [[User:Genjix]]
* [[User:Kiba]]
* [[User:MagicalTux]]
* [[User:Nanotube]]
* [[User:Sgornick]]

However, none of them has shown any recent interest in applying their power in any sort of governance.

MagicalTux is the only [beaurocrat](http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Help:Sysops_and_permissions#Bureaucrats), and nobody else is capable of appointing new admins.

[[user:ripper234]] [was chosen](https://bitcoinfoundation.org/forum/index.php?/topic/51-could-should-the-foundation-manage-the-bitcoinit-wiki/#entry594) by the Bitcoin Foundation (with MagicalTux in its board) to join sgornic as lead wiki admin.

## Future

* More admins are needed to make effective progress in governing the wiki.
* A core set of rules are needed. Admins will enforce these rules.

# Proposed Core Rules

The rules below are only **proposed** at this point, some sort of discussion will take place before they are formalized.
They do not replace [standard wiki etiquette](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Etiquette), but are rather in place to be used where the etiquette fails.

1. Discussions that are not utter rubbish (spam/gibrish) should never be deleted or reverted. [Example of rule violation](https://en.bitcoin.it/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ATonal_Bitcoin&diff=11554&oldid=11522).
1. Edits should respect [NPOV](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Neutral_point_of_view).
	1. In case of dispute, citations should be brought in to support a POV.
	1. Citations should be "convincing". Quoting a few opinions and prefixing an opinion with "some claim that" is not cause to violate NPOV.
1. No [edit wars](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Edit_warring) are allowed.

# Transgression
The rules above will only be enforced starting from a particular future date - past "transgressions" are of course not punishable.
Admins will not be trigger-happy, and any punshiment for breaking the rules can (to some degree) be appealed (recommended medium is posting to bitcointalk).

However, rules without a bite are meaningless, and so appropriate measures will be used to enforce this set of rules.
The measures include warnings, locking articles, temporary bans, and ultimately might include permanent bans.
