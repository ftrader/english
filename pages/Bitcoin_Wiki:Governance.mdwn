Until further notice, [ripper234](User:ripper234) is the maintainer of this page.

Please visit [the related forum thread on bitcointalk](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=157857.0) to see discussion. Do not make significant changes to this page without reaching a consensus of admins.

This article describes the governance of this wiki.

# History
## Current state
There is a set of six [users with admin](https://en.bitcoin.it/w/index.php?title=Special:ListUsers&group=sysop) rights:

* [[User:Genjix]]
* [[User:Kiba]]
* [[User:MagicalTux]]
* [[User:Nanotube]]
* [[User:Sgornick]]
* [[User:Ripper234]] - Added on March 2013

MagicalTux is the only [beaurocrat](http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Help:Sysops_and_permissions#Bureaucrats), and nobody else is capable of appointing new admins.

[[This page|Wiki_admin_nominations]] will contain nominations for new admins, and hopefully some of them will be added in the future.

# Core Rules

I (ripper234) consider the rules below as **official policy** at this point. Other admins will be encouraged (by not forced) to enforce them, and users will be encouraged to report violations of these rules - please use the above bitcointalk thread for this purpose.

They do not replace [standard wiki etiquette](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Etiquette), but are rather in place to be used where the etiquette fails. Other users / admins may disagree with these rules - please take up the disagreement to the bitcointalk thread.

1. Discussions that are not utter rubbish (spam/gibrish) should never be deleted or reverted. [Example of rule violation](https://en.bitcoin.it/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ATonal_Bitcoin&diff=11554&oldid=11522). Archiving is a solution that can be used to clean up cluttered pages, in stead of deletion/revertion.
1. Edits should respect [NPOV](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Neutral_point_of_view). Do not merely revert edits if you disagree with some perspective; instead, try to rephrase the language in a way that does not change the original perspective, while being more agreeable to your own.
1. Avoid [revert wars](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Reverting), they are unproductive. Seek cooperative solutions and compromises which satisfy everyone. Perfection is not a goal here.
	1. In case of dispute, citations should be brought in to support a POV.
	1. Citations should be "convincing". Quoting a few opinions and prefixing an opinion with "some claim that" is not cause to violate NPOV.	
1. No [edit wars](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Edit_warring) are allowed.

# Transgression
The rules above will be enforced starting from 14 April 2013 - past "transgressions" are of course not punishable.

Admins will not be trigger-happy, and any punishment for breaking the rules can (to some degree) be appealed (recommended medium is posting to bitcointalk).

However, rules without a bite are meaningless, and so appropriate measures will be used to enforce this set of rules.

The measures include warnings, locking articles, temporary bans, and ultimately might include permanent bans.
