This article describes the governance of this wiki. It is currently under discussion/construction. Your input is welcome on the [discussion page](Talk:Wiki_governance).

# Current state
There is a set of six [users with admin](https://en.bitcoin.it/w/index.php?title=Special:ListUsers&group=sysop) rights:

* [[User:Genjix]]
* [[User:Kiba]]
* [[User:MagicalTux]]
* [[User:Nanotube]]
* [[User:Sgornick]]
* [[User:Ripper234]] - Added on March 2013

MagicalTux is the only [beaurocrat](http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Help:Sysops_and_permissions#Bureaucrats), and nobody else is capable of appointing new admins.

[[This page|Wiki_admin_nominations]] will contain nominations for new admins, and hopefully some of them will be added in the future, as needed.

# Core Rules

Ideally, we would all follow [standard wiki etiquette](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Etiquette). In addition to this, here are some proposed main guidelines to follow.

1. Edits should respect [NPOV](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Neutral_point_of_view). Do not merely revert edits if you disagree with some perspective; instead, try to rephrase the language in a way that does not change the original perspective, while being more agreeable to your own. Discussing things on the talk page is never a bad idea.
1. Discussions that are not utter rubbish (spam/gibberish) should not be deleted or reverted. Though everything remains in history, archiving rather than deleting makes things easier to find later. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Archiving_a_talk_page for how wikipedia does it. (The template stuff probably doesn't exist here.)
1. Avoid [revert wars](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Reverting) and [edit wars](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Edit_warring) they are unproductive. Seek cooperative solutions and compromises which satisfy everyone. Perfection is not a goal here.
	1. In case of dispute, citations should be brought in to support a POV.
	1. Citations should be "convincing". Quoting a few opinions and prefixing an opinion with "some claim that" is not cause to violate NPOV.
1. Wikipedia has a lot to say about [dispute resolution](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Dispute_resolution). Read it. Then start hoping we never have to deal with such complexity.
	1. In brief, these guidelines say: 1. talk it over. if that fails, 2. request community input. if that fails, 3. more formal mediation by neutral third party.

# Complaints

To report a violation of the guidelines, contact one or more wiki admin via user talk page, email, forum, or IRC - whatever method(s) the person has listed on the user page.

Continued edit wars or other unproductive cycles may merit administrative actions such as warnings, locking articles, temporary or permanent bans.
