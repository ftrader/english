This article describes the governance of this wiki.

# History
## Current state
Currently (March 2013), the wiki is effectively without government. There is a set of six [users with admin](https://en.bitcoin.it/w/index.php?title=Special:ListUsers&group=sysop) rights:

* [[User:Genjix]]
* [[User:Kiba]]
* [[User:MagicalTux]]
* [[User:Nanotube]]
* [[User:Sgornick]]
* [[User:Ripper234]] - Added on March 2013

MagicalTux is the only [beaurocrat](http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Help:Sysops_and_permissions#Bureaucrats), and nobody else is capable of appointing new admins.

[[This page|Wiki_admin_nominations]] will contain nominations for new admins, and hopefully some of them will be added in the future.

## Future

* More admins are needed to make effective progress in governing the wiki.
* A core set of rules are needed. Admins will enforce these rules.

# Proposed Core Rules

The rules below are only **proposed** at this point, some sort of discussion will take place before they are formalized.
They do not replace [standard wiki etiquette](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Etiquette), but are rather in place to be used where the etiquette fails.

1. Discussions that are not utter rubbish (spam/gibberish) should never be deleted or reverted. An an exception, resolved and/or dead conversations may be pruned as necessary to make cluttered Talk pages more manageable. Archival pages may also be used to separate historical content from current material. 
1. Edits should respect [NPOV](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Neutral_point_of_view). Do not merely revert edits if you disagree with some perspective; instead, try to rephrase the language in a way that does not disenfrancise the original perspective, while being more agreeable to your own.
1. Avoid [revert wars](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Reverting), they are unproductive. Seek cooperative solutions and compromises which satisfy everyone. Perfection is not a goal here.

# Transgression
The rules above will only be enforced starting from a particular future date - past "transgressions" are of course not punishable.
Admins will not be trigger-happy, and any punshiment for breaking the rules can (to some degree) be appealed (recommended medium is posting to bitcointalk).

However, rules without a bite are meaningless, and so appropriate measures will be used to enforce this set of rules.
The measures include warnings, locking articles, temporary bans, and ultimately might include permanent bans.
