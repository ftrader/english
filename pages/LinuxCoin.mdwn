A lightweight Debian-based OS which includes in the image everything that is necessary to run as a Bitcoin client and everything needed to get started mining on ATI hardware.

LinuxCoin has many ways to communicate with friends / traders to get you buying, selling and purchasing goods with no hassle and piece of mind.

This software was launched on May 06, 2011 (1.1).
