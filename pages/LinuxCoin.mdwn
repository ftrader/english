A lightweight Debian-based OS which includes in the image everything that is necessary to run as a Bitcoin client and everything needed to get started mining on ATI hardware.

LinuxCoin installs onto flash media and allows you to take your wallet where ever you go. It's a full Operating system so won't interfere or leave files on the PC's internal HDD and can be encrypted 256bit for added security.

LinuxCoin has many ways to communicate with friends / traders to get you buying, selling and purchasing goods with no hassle and peace of mind.

This software was launched on May 06, 2011 (1.1).
