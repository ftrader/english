A **Distributed Autonomous Community** (**DAC**) is an "entity" without any central point of control, with a certain agenda, business plan, and protocol. A **Decentralized Application** or **DA** is an alternative formulation of a DAC. The concept is currently being developed by David Johnston.

There is an accelerating trend of more and more DACs being formed.
