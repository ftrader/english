**CoinCorner** is a universal [[Bitcoin]] solutions provider, based in the [Isle of Man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isle_of_Man). It was founded in June 2014 by Daniel Scott, David Brown, Phil Collins and Charlie Woolnough as a solution to the problem of wanting to buy Bitcoin in the [United Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom). (1.1) The Company was self-funded for the first 10 months, but has since raised an undisclosed amount of funding from a private investor. 

CoinCorner launched as the first [[Bitcoin exchange|Exchanges]] on the Isle of Man. (1.2) It currently accepts deposits via bank transfer, credit and debit card and claims to be “Arguably the easiest to use Bitcoin exchange in the world”, (1.3) with two simple entries and one-click trading. 

CoinCorner is focused on security and keeps over 90% of customer funds in [[cold_storage]] as well as offering [two-stage authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-factor_authentication) to all users. (1.3)

It currently offers an exchange, mobile wallet (for [Android](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)), [iOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOS) and [Windows Phone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Phone)), Bitcoin Payment Gateway and Point of Sale application  (1.4).

##History
The development of the platform began in May 2014 with a team of 3.

CoinCorner was founded on 18 June 2014.

CoinCorner launched Phase 2 in September 2014, which included:

* Public/Private APIs
* Mobile Cloud Wallets for iOS and Android.
* Point of Sale App and Terminal

In January 2015, CoinCorner moved to offices in [Douglas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas,_Isle_of_Man), in the centre of the Isle of Man’s business district.

The Isle of Man introduced regulations for digital currency businesses on 1st April 2015, (2.2) and CoinCorner became the first cryptocurrency exchange in the world to fall under the Proceeds of Crime Act 2008 on the Isle of Man. The Company received an undisclosed amount of funding from a private investor and expanded the team to 7 employees.

##Bitcoin and the Isle of Man

The Isle of Man has welcomed Bitcoin-related businesses, (3.1) with Head of e-commerce for the Isle of Man, Peter Greenhill, telling [Business Insider](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Insider), "The aim is to be the most attractive place in the world for cryptocurrency companies to work from." (3.2)

The [Isle of Man Government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isle_of_Man_Government) amended the Proceeds of Crime Act 2008, introducing regulations to cover Bitcoin companies, including exchanges, operating on the island from 1 April 2015. They believe that "A combination of regulation and encouragement can not only reverse Bitcoin's reputation, but also push it towards the mainstream." (3.3) These businesses must now comply with the Isle of Man’s anti-money laundering (AML) laws.
