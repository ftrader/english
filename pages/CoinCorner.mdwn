The Isle of Man introduced regulations for digital currency businesses on 1st April 2015, (7.2) and CoinCorner became the first cryptocurrency exchange in the world to fall under the Proceeds of Crime Act 2008 on the Isle of Man.

On 16th September 2015, CoinCorner announced the launch of its European market (7.3). This included EUR/BTC trading, SEPA added to the list of payment options and a German version of the site. 

##Bitcoin and the Isle of Man

The Isle of Man has welcomed Bitcoin-related businesses, (8.1) with Head of e-commerce for the Isle of Man, Peter Greenhill, telling [Business Insider](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Insider), "The aim is to be the most attractive place in the world for cryptocurrency companies to work from." (8.2)

The [Isle of Man Government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isle_of_Man_Government) amended the Proceeds of Crime Act 2008, introducing regulations to cover Bitcoin companies, including exchanges, operating on the island from 1 April 2015. They believe that "A combination of regulation and encouragement can not only reverse Bitcoin's reputation, but also push it towards the mainstream." (8.3) These businesses must now comply with the Isle of Man’s anti-money laundering (AML) laws.
