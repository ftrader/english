Major structural changes:

* "Flip the chain", instead of committing to new transactions, commit to the summaries of open transactions: [(1)](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=505.0) [(2)](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=21995.0)

Transaction behavior changes:

* Improved signature types to allow for partial malleability of outputs.  (e.g. make it easier to add a fee onto someone elses transaction, or to take fees from a transaction without outputs set aside for that putpose)

Cryptographic changes:

* Pervasive ECC public key-recovery to reduce transaction sizes (can be done partially without breaking compatibility completely)
* Support for a post-quantum signature scheme. [Lamport signatures](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamport_signature) have nice intuitive security properties, but it and all other similar schemes have extreme space requirements that would require structural changes to the blockchain to accommodate.

Navel gazing / Protocol housekeeping:

* Byte order consistency
* Eliminate redundancies in the variable length integer encodings
* Avoiding hashes covering malleable fields
