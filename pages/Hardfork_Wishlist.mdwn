####Major structural changes

* "Flip the chain", instead of committing to new transactions, commit to the summaries of open transactions: [(1)](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=505.0) [(2)](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=21995.0)
* Increased efficiency for merged mining, restructure the primary header to make the bitcoin specific data non-mandatory. (e.g. the block chain specific stuff would go into second header connected by a header tree), making the primary headers pure timestamps.

####Transaction behavior changes

* Improved signature types to allow for partial malleability of outputs.  (e.g. make it easier to add a fee onto someone elses transaction, or to take fees from a transaction without outputs set aside for that putpose)

####Cryptographic changes

* Pervasive ECC public key-recovery to reduce transaction sizes (can be done partially without breaking compatibility completely)
* Support for a post-quantum signature scheme. [Lamport signatures](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamport_signature) have nice intuitive security properties, but it and all other similar schemes have extreme space requirements that would require structural changes to the blockchain to accommodate.

####Currency changes
*Please don't list anything here which would significantly change the committed overall economics of the system, these things will _never_ be changed in Bitcoin, because such changes would undermine the trust people have in the system, though they may form the basis of an interesting [[alternative chain|Alternative_Chains]].* 

* Increase currency granularity: three more decimal places would still fit all Bitcoin in 2^62 (e.g. you could sum any two signed bitcoin values without overflow in 64 bits) and would allow for pico-btc.

####Navel gazing / Protocol housekeeping

* Byte order consistency
* Eliminate redundancies in the variable length integer encodings
* Avoiding hashes covering malleable fields

####Bug fixes

* CHECKMULTISIG popping one-too-many items off the stack
* difficulty adjustment periods should overlap (prevent potential 'timejacking')
