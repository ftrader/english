Krad Miner is a Firefox 4 extension that uses WebCL and the video card (GPU) to mine bitcoins.  According to [its home page](http://kradminer.com/) Krad Miner is "1,000 - 30,000 times faster than a Javascript based Bitcoin miner".

As of June 22, 2011 a statement left on http://kradminer.com indicates that due to denial of service attacks and other mischief krad miner will be shutting down. The author goes on to state that he wrote the software in about 5 days and had intended to open source the software. However no one he spoke to was willing to purchase the software rights for the price of 50btc, the reasoning for not opening the codebase is vague and uncertain. 

"So unless a better offer comes along I have no intention to release this specific code, since it will likely just be used for pathetic rip off sites." - quote from krad miner
