**BTC Mart**, announced January 16, 2011 (1.1), features free online classified advertisements for goods and services in which the seller accepts bitcoins. Languages supported at time of launch include Russian and English.

This is the first known site to specifically feature online classifieds for Bitcoin-related [[eCommerce|tags/ECommerce]].  This is in contrast to other user to user [[eCommerce|tags/ECommerce]] websites such as craigslist.com where payment terms either allowing or requiring payment with bitcoins (1.2) have been posted in the past.
