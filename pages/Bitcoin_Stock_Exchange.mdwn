The Bitcoin Stock Exchange(BSE) is an online trading platform intended to provide a venue from which Bitcoin related stocks can be issued, bought and sold, using Bitcoin exclusively. We welcome anyone to open an account, whether it be as a trader or as a company. No initial cost or fees are required to do so.

The idea that held promise of the BSE was conceived in spring 2011, and after undergoing some time in the developmental stages, it came to fruition in the summer 2013. Thus beginning to take shape as the exchange we see today.

The general philosophy behind the exchange is to help catalyze progression in the development of the Bitcoin infrastructure, thus solidifying Bitcoin as a practical means of exchange instead of only being the mere vessel of pure price speculation.
