CatLab Bitcoin Gateway is an apparently inactive project to develop bitcoin processing backend software.  It was developed by [Catlab Interactive](https://www.catlab.eu/) for their own purposes and somewhat opened to the public.  The project now appears to be on hiatus with a message on the main CatLab Interactive website  (1.1) stating that they suffered a significant security breach in September 2012.
