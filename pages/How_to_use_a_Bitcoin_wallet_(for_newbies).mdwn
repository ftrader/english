This page aims to be the best resource for new users to understand how Bitcoin wallets work, and how to use them.

## Introduction

To use Bitcoin, some sort of wallet is needed. There are [several wallet programs](http://bitcoin.org/clients.html) from you to choose from, as well as a web wallet called My Wallet.

## Security
Before proceeding, you should [[make sure your computer system is secure|Securing_your_wallet#Making_a_secure_workspace]].

## My Wallet
My Wallet is a [[web wallet|Browser-based_wallet]]. It is rather similar to PayPal in its usage. Here is a simple how to:

1. Open an account
1. [[Choose a strong password|Securing_your_wallet#Password_Strength]]
	1. **Note** - there is no "reset your password" feature. You must not lose your password.
1. Recommended: Associate an email address with the account, for backup purposes.
1. You now have a [[Bitcoin Address|Address]], which you can use to receive payments - just email your address to another person, and he can send money directly to this address.
	1. **Note** - anyone who knows your address might be able to analyze your transactions and estimate how much Bitcoins you own. [Understand that Bitcoin is pseudonymous](http://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/52/how-anonymous-are-bitcoin-transactions), not anonymous.
