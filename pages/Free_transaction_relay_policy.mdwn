The original client currently refuses to relay transactions it considers "unacceptable". However, there may be miners that are willing to put these in a block. This group is for people who want to send such transactions, and those who want to put them in blocks.

For now, please simply maintain a connection to [[Luke-Jr's node|Fallback_nodes]]. While he requires (low) fees for all transactions, he will relay indiscriminately. This means that you can broadcast your transaction to him, and he will relay it to any miner who also has a connection to him. If your transaction meets the policies of at least one miner connected, it should eventually get into a block.
