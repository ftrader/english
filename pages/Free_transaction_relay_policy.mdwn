The original client currently refuses to relay transactions it considers "unacceptable". However, there may be miners that are willing to put these in a block. This group is for people who want to send such transactions, and those who want to put them in blocks.

Simply have your node maintain a connection to [[Lightfoot Hosting's node|Fallback_nodes]], which relays indiscriminately. This means that you can broadcast your transaction to it, and it will relay it to any miner who also has a connection to it. If your transaction meets the policies of at least one miner connected, it should eventually get into a block.
