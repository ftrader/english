## Things to improve

Learned from late thefts, people will really want easier ways to keep their coins safe. It can be done by discarding the single-wallet paradigm bitcoin is using.

Users need:

* Separate wallets and ways to transfers between them
* Easy encryption (with readymade tools) and access of encrypted wallets
* Wallets on memory sticks
* Possibly yet, an external memory device that can sign transactions with user's approval
