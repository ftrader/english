The most widely used bitcoin [[currency_exchange]] market. Bitcoins are bought on using funds from the trader's MTGUSD balance with Mt. Gox and when bitcoins are the funds from the proceeds are added to the trader's MTGUSD account with Mt. Gox.

Trades on Mt. Gox's execute from balances on deposit with the exchange which in turn makes trading on the market instantaneous, compared to some other Bitcoin markets where a subsequent settlement occurs manually between the trading partners.

##Trading
###Buying
A buy order is executed partially or in full when the price bid can be matched against a sell order that is at or below the bid amount.

###Selling
A sell order is executed partially or in full when the price asked can be matched against a buy order that is at or above the ask amount.

###Dark Pool
A dark pool allows large quantities to be sold without the orders being visible.  This helps to lessen the price moves that would likely result when the price and size of a large order is known.

####Dark Pool Only Orders
Can be filled only by other dark pool orders or a single normal order that is larger than the dark pool order. This means that if there is a single normal order that would fill the dark pool order both will be filled.

####Dark Pool + Normal Orders
Can be filled either partially from the normal orders or the dark pool. 

###Fees
Mt. Gox subtracts a 0.65% trading fee from each party of successful trades made through the market.  The fee is drawn from the amount received as the result of the trade.

##Adding Funds

###BTC
There are no fees incurred when transferring bitcoins to a Mt. Gox account.  Funds are available once [[confirmed|confirmation]] (6 blocks) (10.1), a process that can take roughly an hour.

Note: Even though the site displays no ads, some browser ad-blocking utilities will interfere with the exchange's web site, specifically with the Add Bitcoins function.

###LRUSD
There are no fees incurred when adding [[Liberty_Reserve]] LRUSD funds to an account.  Funds are available in minutes.

###Dwolla
This option is among the fastest and least expensive methods for adding funds to a Mt. Gox account.  The transaction fee on [[Dwolla]] costs just $0.25.  The process is automated and the funds are available for trading shortly after the payment is sent.  [From minutes to hours.](Update:)

###ACH
The exchange can accept transfers made via [ACH](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_Clearing_House) and Mt. Gox reports this as being the least expensive method for funding an account.  Only recently has consumer banking started to provide the ability for an account holder to initiate a payment using ACH to an account other than their own at another financial institution.

###SEPA
The exchange can accept transfers made via SEPA at no charge.  The exchange can accept transfers made via SEPA at no charge.  Funds are converted to USD, at the raw ECB conversion rate and are credited when a SEPA batch is processed, daily.

###Bank wire
The exchange is charged $15 for a U.S. bank wire and $50 for an international bank wire.  The exchange requests that you contact them in advance for details.

##Withdrawing Funds
MtGox imposes a $1000 USD limit for withdrawals per 24 hours.  Withdrawals of BTCs count toward this limit and are calculated at the exchange value at the time of the attempted withdrawal.

###BTC
Bitcoins may be withdrawn at no charge.

There have been sporadic reports where withdrawing the entire bitcoin balance results in an error message.  This could the be the result of a possible error where the amount available for withdrawal gets miscalculated due to a rounding error.  In at least one instance, a subsequent attempt to withdraw all but the last 1 BTC completed successfully.

###LRUSD
There are two fees incurred when withdrawing LRUSD.  Mt. Gox themselves subtracts 1% of the transfer amount as a fee before transferring away.  Liberty Reserve then subtracts as a transfer fee 1% from the amount they've received.

For example, to withdraw $100 LRUSD, Mt. Gox will send $99 ($100 less a 1% fee) (18.1)  Liberty Reserve will subtract $0.99 ($99 less a 1% fee) leaving a net amount at Liberty Received of $98.01.
