**MyBitcoin** is one of the earliest [[eWallet]] providers for Bitcoin. See [[MyBitcoin_SCI]] if you're looking for information on how to use MyBitcoin merchant service.

Bitcoins sent from a MyBitcoin account will not necessarily originate from the same [[bitcoin addresses|Address]] that were used to receive the Bitcoins. This property can be utilised to improve [[anonymity|Anonymity]].

Amounts sent to an account on MyBitcoin will be [[confirmed|Confirmation]] after just one block and will then show in the balance and can be spent immediately.

##Features

* Address forwarding - Anything earned in your mybitcoin account can be transfered automatically to a desired address.
##External links

* [MyBitcoin site](https://www.mybitcoin.com/)

##History
For a period of a day or so beginning 02-17-2011, deposits to the mybitcoin.com eWallet service were not being registered to users' accounts. (4.1)

##Criticism

Due to MyBitcoin's practice of crediting an account after the transaction appears in just one [[block]], a prudent step might be to [[manually verify|blockexplorer]] confirmation before delivering -- especially if there is no recourse should the payment fail to confirm.
