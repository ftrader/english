> *This page is about Mac OS X compatible distributions of cgminer.  For the project bundled with a launcher GUI, see [[cgminer_for_Mac_OS_X_(project)]].

There are several unofficial projects which compile [[CGMiner]] for use with Mac OS X:

* [cgminer and bfgminer for Mac OS X](http://fabulouspanda.co.uk/commandline)
* [cgminer for Mac OS X (project)](http://spaceman.ca/cgminer)
* [How to compile cgminer and bfgminer with Homebrew for Mac OS X](http://blog.nwoolls.com/2013/04/24/bitcoin-mining-on-mac-os-x-cgminer-bfgminer/)
* [xgminer](http://www.xgminer.com)

Some of the above projects have also been incorporated into Mac-compatible graphical user interface (GUI) wrappers, which often present a more feature-rich experience for the normal desktop user.

* [MacMiner](http://macminer.net)
* [[MultiMiner]]
