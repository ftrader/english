**Proof of burn** is a potential alternative to [[proof of work|Proof_of_work]] and [[proof of stake|Proof_of_Stake]] as a "scarce resource" to be exhibited by miners competing for the stream of rewards (minted coins and transaction fees) which a cryptocurrency's design makes available. The idea is that miners should show proof that they *burned* some coins - that is, sent them to a verifiably unspendable address. This is expensive from their individual point of view, just like proof of work; but unlike proof of work, it consumes no real resources from a whole economy perspective. This has interesting implications, discussed below.

There are likely many possible variants of proof of burn. This page currently describes [Iain Stewart](User:Ids)'s version. Other people can add variant versions that still belong to the broad proof of burn idea.
