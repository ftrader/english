Hello Fellow Bitcoiners,
This is the owner of the new exchange website called bitbrothersllc.com . As a compnay, we do things differnently than most exchange companies in that we accept not only bank transfers and other forms of regular payment, but that we accept cold hard cash mailed in orders. This allows some of our customer base to stay completely anonymous. Ironically, many of our competitors have eliminated the possiblity of staying anonymous through a transaction which was the entire point of the bitcoin buzz in the first place. We can also assure our customers that when it comes to bitcoin exchanges, no one can parellel the customer service in terms of speed and honesty than bitbrothersllc.com . We hope to do some exchanges with you.

p.s. previously known as bitcoinbycc.com but changed websites with a change in management. Spread the word and check us out!
