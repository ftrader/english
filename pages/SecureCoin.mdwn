An escrow-like service that allows safer payment by securely holding a buyer's coins in escrow until the terms of the sale are met and as a result the buyer releases payment to the seller. Furthermore there is an id verification service. Users can confirm their identity and share them with other users about so-called public IDs.

##Fees

The service is currently for free.

##History

The site was launched on July 2011 (3.1). On September 2011 the site merged with the Bitcoin trading portal & auction house [Bitmit](http://www.bitmit.net).
