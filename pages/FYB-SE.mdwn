##Trading

###Buying/selling

You specify the quantity of Bitcoins you wish to buy/sell at a price.<br\>

Once you have submitted a trade, the following chain of events take place : <br\>

	

1. FYB will try to fill your order with other pending orders at the same or better price than you indicated.<br\>

In other words if you try to buy 1BTC at 100kr, FYB will attempt to fill your order with the lowest selling price orders up till 100kr.<br\>

If there are sell orders below 100kr, you will be filled at a better rate.

	

2. If your entire order is filled, execution stops.<br\> If there is a partial fill(ie. only 0.8BTC could be bought at/below 100kr) then the remaining qty is listed as a pending order(Buy Pending Order 0.2BTC at 100kr)
