	Here is what I can do:
	1. Programming in Ruby, and Javascript. I spent much of my time in those two languages. Other languages I could handle: Python, java. Other language, I barely touch: C. I am perfectly suitable for creating small scripts, little web projects, and anything that's not too aglorithmtic or required advanced mathematics.
	2. Writing. I recently got paid for an article. Might be worth hiring.
	3. Art. So-so.
