Is is [my](User:Ripper234) belief that the wiki is currently under-moderated, and that a few more wiki admins are needed.

This page will contain serious nominations to the role of wiki admins.
Anyone can nominate anybody else or himeself, but the page will be kept clean and people without significant contribution or acknowledgement to Bitcoin will be removed from it.

## ThePiachu
I, ripper234, nominate ThePiachu as a wiki admin.

* His contribution to Bitcoin is significant (it includes an academic paper about Bitcoin)
* I trust him with the role of admin
* I believe he has shown interest in the role
<hr/>

* I, regretfully, oppose at this time. ThePiachu has been almost completely inactive here and so I cannot point to any work he'd be engaging in which would be facilitated by making him an administrator at this time. --[Gmaxwell](User:Gmaxwell) ([[talk|User_talk:Gmaxwell]]) 20:10, 29 March 2013 (GMT)
