Purecoin is a Haskell full-node implementation, by [Russell O'Connor](http://r6.ca/), available [on github](https://github.com/laanwj/Purecoin) (mirrored from darcs).  On its completeness and motivations, Russell comments:

* [purecoin tries to be as simiple an implementation as I can get away with. The idea is more for documentation than for real use.](http://bitcoinstats.com/irc/bitcoin-dev/logs/2011/11/28#l1322491573)
* [it doesn't handle OP_IF, but I'm pretty sure there are many more unknown incompatibilities.](http://bitcoinstats.com/irc/bitcoin-dev/logs/2011/11/28#l1322495797)
* [I guarentee that purecoin is not entirely compatible with bitcoin](http://bitcoinstats.com/irc/bitcoin-dev/logs/2011/11/28#l1322495724)
