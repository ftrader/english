## Blockchain Explorer

### Web Interface

**[Blockr.io](https://www.blockr.io)** provides a [[blockchain|Block_chain]] explorer of coins to a human-readable form and presents them to users in a friendly and intuitive way. API access is also available for automatic scripts. **[blockr.io](https://www.blockr.io)** was evolving for 6 months in private beta without interruptions, and it can parse and present data as [[blocks|Blocks]], [[transactions|Transactions]] and [[addresses|Address]] from almost any digital currency running on Bitcoin fork.

### API

API's are here to help developers access our internal database. We made [API's to access coin data](http://blockr.io/documentation/api), block, transaction and address information, unspent tx and much more. APIs are free to use as long as you don't flood the system.
