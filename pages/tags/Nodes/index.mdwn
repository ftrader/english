A full node connects to the Bitcoin network, maintains the blockchain, and relays memory pool transactions traffic based on policies.

##Consensus

Nodes other than the [[original client|Original_Bitcoin_client]] risk creating a hard fork if widely deployed and not following the consensus code as implemented in the original client 100% (bug-for-bug). There is no documented standard for Bitcoin consensus, so presently the implementation is considered the de facto standard.

The original client consensus code is maintained as a sub-library called libbitcoinconsensus within the client's source code. (2.1) A clone of the original client consensus code is maintained as a standalone library called [[libbitcoin-consensus|Libbitcoin_Consensus]] as part of the [[Libbitcoin]] development toolkit.
