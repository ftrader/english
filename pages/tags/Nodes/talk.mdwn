Now there is redundancy. This category "node" is exactly the same as the category "client"

I would suggest the following structure:

* software
	* clients (same as "nodes")
	* frontends (divided in two subcategories)
		* User interfaces
		* API Bindings


* Please read over the [[Infrastructure]]. --[Luke-jr](User:Luke-jr) 05:21, 27 June 2011 (GMT)
