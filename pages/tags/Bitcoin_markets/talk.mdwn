##Suggestion to rename category bitcoin-markets to bitcoin-exchanges

Suggest to rename this category to "Bitcoin exchanges", since, say, biddingpond is also a 'bitcoin market'. "Market" is too broad, given that this category is clearly intended for just the exchanges. --[Nanotube](User:Nanotube) 07:36, 26 December 2010 (GMT)
