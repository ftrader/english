Services that enable safer transactions by acting as payment intermediary.

Some services may also offer reputation and/or dispute resolution as well.

<span style="color:red">Warning: Please be careful with your money. When sending money to an escrow agent in a non-multisignature transaction, you are trusting that the operator will not abscond with your funds and that the operator maintains secure systems that protect against theft -- internal or external.
Using multisignature transactions are currently more complex, and do not guarantee your funds protection, but they can be very useful for 2 party or 3 party escrow transactions</span>
