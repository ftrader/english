Here is a lot of software that does not fit the definition "Client" as given on the top of the page. They should be moved to a different category.[Prof7bit](User:Prof7bit) 11:46, 25 June 2011 (GMT)

* Except that this isn't the definition used in common-speak. To most people, a "frontend" (more often called a "user interface") is the client. The contents of this category should be split between Nodes (which implement at least the p2p protocol) and Wallets (which implement at least the wallet management). See [[Infrastructure]] for an overview. --[Luke-jr](User:Luke-jr) 15:11, 25 June 2011 (GMT)
