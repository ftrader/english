Hey,

I am looking for the Category "Games" where I can put our Bitcoin exchange game in the list. Unfortunately, the Category "Games" seems only to accommodate the type of games which require Bitcoins to pay for. I have problems understanding why the Bitcoin Games are limited to "has to be paid for", if there is already a whole category that is about "Gambling"?

Is it ok for me to just create another list: "Games that require NO Bitcoin to play" or "Free to play Bitcoin games"?
