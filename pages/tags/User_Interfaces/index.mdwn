A user interface is what the end-user sees and interacts with. Some clients like the original bitcoin client already have their own user interface built in but alternative user interfaces with more sophisticated features can optionally be used to control the client.

Technically they connect to the running client (which can even run on a different computer) via the JSON-RPC protocol and fall into the category [[Frontends|tags/Frontends]] together with the various available [[API Bindings|tags/API_Bindings]] for different programming langauges.
