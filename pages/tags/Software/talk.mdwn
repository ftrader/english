## different system of categories

It would be desirable to have the bitcoin clients and other software grouped in the following categories:

* JSON clients for one's own bitcoind
* full featured bitcoin p2p implementation (full replacement for the official client)
* partial / minimal / "thin" implementation of p2p protocol (something like bitcoinj for example)

and maybe at least 3 words of description behind each link in the list to avoid clicking of dozens of links only to find out what category they are in. [Prof7bit](User:Prof7bit) 11:41, 25 June 2011 (GMT)
