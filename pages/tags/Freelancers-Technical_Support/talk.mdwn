Hello, my name is Joe and I'm a cyber security tech, an ethical hacker, penetration tester and independent researcher who is available for one-time, or part-time, variable length independent projects, collaboration and consulting. 

I've helped people in the past find someone who they had lost contact with for many years and couldn't track down. I've put a stop to cyber-bullying and harassment. I can thoroughly research and find anything that is on the net and I have access to many resources, and the technical skill, to do so. 

Penetration testing and ethical hacking is my passion and I've helped various individuals and organizations get an accurate picture of their security posture, and patch some serious vulnerabilities, through a pen-test . I'm extremely intelligent and have many other skills, real-world experience and qualifications that are too numerous to list here but that gives you a general idea. 

I'll seriously consider any request for my services as long as it includes reasonable compensation and is legal to do in the USA, so don't hesitate to contact me.
