To be "good," a page must be:

* well referenced or otherwise authentic
* relevant to Bitcoin
* well written
* broad, yet focused
* fully neutral
* static (that is, not changing constantly)
* generally helpful
* either about a defunct company/service or not about one at all
* either about a person that does not have a known bitcoin wiki account or not about a person at all
* not a stub
* in the mainspace and not a redirect

To mark a page as good put <nowiki>{{good}}</nowiki> anywhere on it.

Don't mark a page as good when it clearly is not.

Don't mark a product, company, organization, service or program page as a good page (unless it is defunct).
