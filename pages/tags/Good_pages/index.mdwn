To be "good," a page must be:

* well referenced or otherwise authentic
* relevant to Bitcoin
* well written
* broad, yet focused
* fully neutral
* static (that is, not changing constantly)
* generally helpful
* not a stub
* in the mainspace and not a redirect

To mark a page as good put <nowiki>{{good}}</nowiki> anywhere on it.

**Don't mark a page as good without discussion.**
