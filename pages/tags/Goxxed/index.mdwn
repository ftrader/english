Goxxed is a loose slang term started in the Bitcoin community.  It is a derogatory term and references [[Mt_Gox]].  In February 2014, the once largest Bitcoin Exchange in the world, Mt. Gox went offline and filed bankruptcy proceedings thereafter.  However before that event they had removed bitcoin withdrawals from their platform. This event happened roughly 9 months following their Fiat Withdrawals being frozen.  Many members of the Bitcoin Community lost trust and favor with Mt. Gox after those actions, and many members resorted to selling their 'Gox Coins' for reduced value in efforts to retrieve liquidity that was locked in the site)  This category has been created to assign all to all BTC companies that have been shut down, filed for bankruptcy or no longer continue operations.
