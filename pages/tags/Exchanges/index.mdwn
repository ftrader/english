<span style="color:red">Warning: Please be careful with your money.  When sending funds to an exchange or other counterparty you are trusting that the operator will not abscond with your bitcoins and that the operator maintains secure systems that protect against theft -- internal or external.  It is recommended that you obtain the real-world identity of the operator and ensure that sufficient recourse is available.  Exchanging or storing significant funds with exchanges is not recommended.</span>

###Real-time Trading
In these systems, users place buys and sells themselves on the exchange and the price is set by a market. The exchange usually acts as a mutual platform between the two parties, holds the funds, executes the trade, then releases funds as requested.

The exchange may take a percent or charge a fee on trades/withdrawals/deposits.

###Fixed rate

A vendor sets a fixed price which people can buy and sell at. The prices may have a spread as a fee for the exchange operator.
