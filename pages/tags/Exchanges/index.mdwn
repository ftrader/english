This is a list of pages dealing with exchanging bitcoins for other forms of currency.

<span style="color:red">Warning: Please be careful with your money.  When sending funds to an exchange or other counterparty you are trusting that the operator will not abscond with your bitcoins and that the operator maintains secure systems that protect against theft -- internal or external.  It is recommended that you obtain the real-world identity of the operator and ensure that sufficient recourse is available.  Exchanging or storing significant funds with exchanges is not recommended.</span>
