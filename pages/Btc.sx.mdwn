**Btc.sx** is a multinational company that engages in leveraged [[bitcoin]]  [[trading|trade]] and [brokerage](wikipedia:brokerage). The company offers a trading platform in [[digital_currency]] derivatives such as [margin trading](wikipedia:margin trading) to retail traders. It was founded in 2013 and is headquartered in London's Silicon Roundabout. ZDNet reports Btc.sx to be one of the first bitcoin companies that voided the necessity of all other currencies other than Bitcoin. (1.1) The company was launched from [Sydney](wikipedia:Sydney), [Australia](wikipedia:Australia), and is run by CEO Joseph Lee who co-founded the company alongside George Samman and Vincent Hoong. (1.2) Shortly after its launch, Lee moved operations to [[London]] favouring a dual incorporation model between [Singapore](Wikipedia:Singapore) and [United Kingdom](Wikipedia:United Kingdom). (1.3) The company also has operations in [New York](Wikipedia:New York).

##Trading
###Buying and selling

Users of Btc.sx can open long and short positions using the proprietary trading platform. A corresponding buy and sell order is then placed out to market at a matching exchange with or without leverage. All positions opened will have a corresponding position placed out to market meaning that any profits gained or losses generated from market movements will be passed on directly to the client.

###Position Deposits

Trading at Btc.sx is done on a pre-paid basis. In order to open a position, a deposit is taken which acts as collateral. This collateral will act as an equivalent of a margin call. This is the price at which a position will be automatically liquidated if losses accrue to the deposited amount. The margin call is shown as a stop price when the position is opened. A larger deposit will enable a bigger stop distance to be chosen. This can result in larger losses if the price moves against the desired direction.

##Risk Matrix

As well as magnifying trading gains, losses can similarly be multiplied. For beginners, it is widely reccomended that trading with a smaller amount of leverage will result in a lower risk whilst learning about the platform while trading. Despite its higher minimum deposit, potential losses will be minimised due to the unlikely nature that a stop limit will be reached. (11.1)



|Leverage |Stop Distance |Risk |Return (Profit or Loss) |Minimum Deposit
|---
|10:1 |Small |High |High |$5
|5:1 |Medium |Medium |Medium |$10
|2:1 |Large |Low |Low |$20


##Reception

Following the [[Mt._Gox]] collapse, Btc.sx announced a new exchange partnership with [[Bitstamp]] now placing its orders out to market. (12.1) The trading platform announced in March 2014 the brokerage of over $40m in brokered transactions. (12.2)

##Capital investments

In April 2014, Btc.sx recieved 500 bitcoins from the seed accelerator, [[SeedCoin]] in its first fund raising round. (13.1) The company has recieved a total of US$0.45 million investment as a result of initial capital injections and its equity fundraising activities. (13.2)

##Service disruptions

In February 2014 [[Mt._Gox]] was struck by a theft, it was the world's largest bitcoin exchange and at its peak handled 70% of all bitcoin trades. (14.1) The loss of 750,000 bitcoins (at the time worth over $350m) triggered immediate insolvency and caused its subsequent collapse. (14.2) Following a trading suspension issued by Btc.sx, it was revealed that Btc.sx had partnered with [[Mt._Gox]] to offer its [brokered](wikipedia:brokerage) trading service and suffered from undisclosed losses as a result of the collapse. (14.3)

##Regulation

Btc.sx operates in a climate of regulatory uncertainty with no specific laws enforced to provide protection to its clients globally. The New York State Department of Financial Services who is overseen by Superintendent Benjamin Lawsky hopes to be the first regulatory body to provide a full framework for [[virtual_currency]] businesses. (15.1) The DFS guidelines are percieved by many bitcoin companies to be overbearing with fierce opposition coming from [[Jeremy_Allaire]], CEO of bitcoin startup [[Circle|Circle_(company)]]. (15.2). With operations in New York, the BitLicense regulations will directly affect Btc.sx and similar bitcoin businesses.
