[bitpotluck.com](http://www.bitpotluck.com) is an elegant lottery game where the prize draw increases as more people play.

Features include:

* Off-blockchain transactions powered by [Inputs.io](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Inputs.io)
* as above, instant entry (no waiting for blockchain confirmation) and no transaction fees
* no site registration required
* no win limits - pot size depends on the number of contributions per pot
* winners are paid out immediately after being selected
* choice of multiple entry fees from as little as 0.001 BTC for light play up to 1 BTC per entry for heavy hitters
* multiple pots with differing time limits for quick 10 minute draws to long 6 hour draws
* provably fair (of course)

Additional features added into the game are:

* pot starting balance increases after every payout
* first 2 contributors of any pot get 1 free ticket (an incentive to join)
* auto-updating on-screen (no page refreshing)

The winner takes 95% of the pot total, where 2% is left in the pot for the next draw. This enables the pot size to increase over time. The other 3% goes to covering hosting costs (and profit, if any).
