<big>*You have been mining for a while and now would be a nice time to cash out? You've learned enough about Bitcoin to know it's the best money out there - the first as good as gold and a lot easier to carry? How can you exchange easily with minimum hassle? Forget about the trust and feedback system. Real traders do business, not friendly chit-chat. (But you're always welcome on **#bitcoin-cad** on **freenode.net** if you want to talk.) 

In Canada you can either trade using the [Over The Counter (OTC)](http://bitcoin-otc.com/) system and its web of trust system, or register with the first Canadian-based exchange- [cavirtex.com](https://www.cavirtex.com). *</big> 

When conducting trades using the OTC you are strongly encouraged to check the rating of individuals you are about to trade with. Look for a cumulative rating of at least 8, that has come from at least 3 other individuals with good ratings, and that is at least 2 weeks old. if you do not have such a rating then you are going to have to trust the party that has a better trust rating than you until you have enough good trades and ratings to have built a good reputation yourself.   

When sending and receiving money the preferred method is a service called Interac, which has a marvellous system called [Interac e-transfer](http://www.interac.ca/consumers/productsandservices_ol_eTransfer.php). Fees are normally between 0 and 2$ per transaction (check with your bank or credit union). 

1. **E-mail the money (minus the password)**;
1. **Send the password by e-mail, IRC, PM on a forum, smoke messages...**

*(Please note it takes around 30 minutes for an Interac e-transfer transfer to be sent.)*
