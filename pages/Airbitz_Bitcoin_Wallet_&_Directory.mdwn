The Airbitz Bitcoin Wallet & Directory/Map is a native mobile app for iOS and Android with a core focus on ease of use and ease of security. Airbitz implements a beautifully designed mobile app with the familiarity of mobile banking but with true Bitcoin functionality under the hood. Users are in full control of their private keys which are created and encrypted on the user's device but backed up to peer-to-peer servers and synchronized with other user devices.

Creation of an Airbitz wallet account requires just a username, password, and PIN. These credentials allow users to access their wallets from any number of iOS or Android devices.
