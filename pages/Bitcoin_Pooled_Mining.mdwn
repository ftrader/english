Slush's pool was announced on November, 27, 2010 under the name Bitcoin Pooled Mining Server and operated on a share strategy that involved an artificially low [[difficulty]] method that has since been determined to be vulnerable to cheating. The pool now follows a score-based method, where older shares (from beginning of the round) have a lower value than newer shares, which serves to demotivate a cheater from switching between pools inside a round. Balances accumulate on the server, and are sent out when a user-set threshold balance is reached. There is a fixed fee of 2%, as of March 10, 2011 (1.1).

The [[coinbase]] signature for this pool is: "/slush/"  (1.2).
