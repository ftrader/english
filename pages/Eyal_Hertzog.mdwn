Eyal hertog has been building internet startups since 1998, when he started with Arnon Di-nur "Contact Networks" - a social network integrated to popular address-book solutions. He later started Metacafe, a video sharing service that reached 50m unique visitors every month. In 2011, Eyal took a two year break from work to independently research a wide range of fields, including history, economy, monetary systems and spirituality, which led him to start, together with four friends, "AppCoin LTD", a cloud solution and a platform for user-generated-currencies. 

Eyal lives in Tel Aviv with his wife and two boys, and loves playing the piano and jamming on the base with his friends.
