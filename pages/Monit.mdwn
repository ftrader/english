Running an monitoring bitcoind with [monit](http://mmonit.com/monit/)

I recommend adding a user account for bitcoin:
	adduser --disabled-login bitcoin

Place the home directory (or at least the .bitcoin/wallet.dat) on an encrypted volume (e.g. [cryptsetup](http://code.google.com/p/cryptsetup/)).
It is also recommended to have a separate wallet for every day use containing only a small amount of coins.

Optional: move your existing .bitcoin directory to the new user and change ownership
	sudo mv .bitcoin ~bitcoin;
	sudo chown -R bitcoin.bitcoin ~bitcoin/.bitcoin

Configure bitcoind in ~bitcoin/bitcoin.conf, you also need to set at least rpcuser and rpcpassword:
	pid=/home/bitcoin/.bitcoin/pid

Create a wrapper for bitcoind in ~bitcoin/bin/bitcoind
	export HOME="/home/bitcoin"
	exec /path/to/the/real/bitcoind "$@"

Optional: You may want to run bitcoind with a lower priority than your interactive applications:
	export HOME="/home/bitcoin"
	exec /usr/bin/nice /usr/bin/ionice -c 3 /path/to/the/real/bitcoind "$@"

Add the following lines to your monitrc (/etc/monitrc or /etc/monit/monitrc) and reload monit:
	check process bitcoind with pidfile /home/bitcoin/.bitcoin/pid
	start program = "/home/bitcoin/bin/bitcoind -daemon" as uid bitcoin and gid bitcoin
	stop program = "/home/bitcoin/bin/bitcoind stop" as uid bitcoin and gid bitcoin
	#if totalmem > 100 MB then restart

If your bitcoind is leaking memory you may want to enable the totalmem check (adjust amount for your needs).
