BTCLook was a block chain browser site with a more technical slant run by Coinkite. It was discontinued later, as Coinkite says:

<blockquote>*BTCLook was an early project to visualize and explore the Bitcoin block chain. It was a fun project, but we have discontinued it to focus entirely on Coinkite.*</blockquote>
