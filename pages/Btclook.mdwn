[BTCLook.com](http://www.btclook.com) is a new block chain browser site with a more technical slant.

This site claims to store the entire block chain, including all transactions in-memory, using a [Redis](http://redis.io/) database.

Visitors can browse and search by hash or block number. Statistics such as largest block, most transactions in one block are displayed. Details for every transaction and every public key are also tracked and interlinked.

There is an interactive "network diagram" which encourages interactive exploring of the transaction tree. Each transaction's inputs and outputs may be expanded with a click of the mouse. The bitcoin flow is show as arrows and relative amounts represented as the diameter of the circle nodes. Details of the transaction are shown in a sidebar. Here is an example [example transaction visualized](http://www.btclook.com/#/txn/cbfdb15da72937a51c831fb55e4227efbd16f161ddd74392ec208d98c0cf284b). 

The testnet is also available at [(1)](http://testnet.btclook.com) visuallized in the same manner.

Works on iPhone and similar small-screened devices. May require the features of a recent HTML5-capable web browser.
