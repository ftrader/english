[[!template id=infobox_company name="BTC Guild" image=[[File:BTCGuild.png 256px]] trading_name="BTC Guild" industry="[[Mining pool]]" founder=[[Eleuthria]] foundation="May 9, 2011" defunct="November 30, 2014" hashrate="11.7 PHash/s" website=http://www.btcguild.com]]BTC Guild is a [[mining pool|Pooled_mining]] which offers proportional based rewards, where your reward is equal to the block value, multiplied by your valid shares submitted during the round.  The pool does not take a fee from each block solved, and calculates rewards to the full 8 decimal points supported by the Bitcoin protocol.  The pool is run off the donations of users, and is offering premium services at different donation levels to encourage users to donate a small percentage of their rewards.  Donations are taken from the individual user's reward when a block is calculated.

2.5% donators (calculated on a per block basis) are able to claim their rewards without waiting for 120 confirmations of the block.  This also acts as invalid protection, similar to [[DeepBit]], where a user can claim rewards even if the block is later invalidated/orphaned by the network.


BTCGuild first opened up on May 9th, 2011. (1.1) It is due to close on November 30, 2014. (1.2)
