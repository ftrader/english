An OpenCart payment module that communicates with a bitcoin client using JSON RPC.

This code accurately converts USD to BTC using the up-to-the-minute MtGox average.  It is completely self contained and requires no cron jobs or external hardware other than a properly configured bitcoind server.  Every order creates a new bitcoin address for payment and gives it a label corresponding to the order_id of the order.  It installs like any other OpenCart plugin and it is completely integrated with OpenCart.

##History

OpenCart Bitcoin was first made available on September 21, 2012 (2.1).
