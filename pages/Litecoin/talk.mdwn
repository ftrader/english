## NPOV attempts

Ripper234 apparently disagrees with the wording of "Bitcoin does not suffer from these "flaws" and therefore does not fall under the "pump and dump" scheme, according to this argument." despite its [[context|Litecoin#Pump_and_Dump_Scheme]]. I've been pondering a way to rephrase it, but not coming up with any good solutions. Anyone else want to take a shot at it? (please don't remove either component of the statement, as they are both relevant to the meaning) --[Luke-jr](User:Luke-jr) ([[talk|User_talk:Luke-jr]]) 02:10, 25 March 2013 (GMT)
