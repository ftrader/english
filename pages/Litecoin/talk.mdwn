>  I've redirected Litecoin to Scrypt. While Litecoin itself admittedly doesn't belong on the Bitcoin Wiki, Scrypt PoW *is* a technology that was significant to the mining industry as a whole. I'm still not sure if it belongs - it'd be a little documentary about TBX and LTC's rise and fall - I'm wondering if we should just get rid of it entirely.
