RE: best practices in ECMAScript:
Just converting to base units doesn't magically fix the issues; if I have 1.0BTC == 100000000.0 base units and I need to divide that value into three equal pieces, I'm going to run into issues whether the result is 0.3333333.... or 3333333.33333...

And the fixes are the same:  either round to the nearest .0000001 or to the nearest 1 before display, etc.


For Ruby I think the syntax is:

#Ruby
(f * 1e8).round.to_f / 1e8

Correct?
