A **digital currency**, (also known as cryptcurrency, cyber currency, digital cash, digital currency, digital money, e-currency, e-money, electronic cash, electronic currency, electronic money) refers to money or scrip which is only exchanged electronically.

Some money transfers such as bank wire transfer and ACH, or even money transfer services such as [[PayPal]] send funds electronically but the currency transmitted is representative money which transfers an underlying fiat currency.
