### What is "difficulty"?

Difficulty is a measure of how difficult it is to find a new [[block]] compared to the easiest it can ever be.

### How often does the difficulty change?

Every 2016 [[blocks|block]].

### What is the formula for difficulty?

difficulty = maximum_target / current_target 

(target is a 256 bit number)

### What is the current difficulty?
[Current difficulty](http://blockexplorer.com/q/getdifficulty), as output by BitCoin's getDifficulty.

### What is the maximum difficulty?
The maximum difficulty is roughly: maximum_target / 1, which is a ridiculously huge number (about 2^224). 

The actual maximum difficulty is when current_target=0, but we would not be able to calculate the difficulty if that happened. (fortunately it never will, so we're ok.)

### Can the difficulty go down?
Yes it can. See discussion in [[target]].

### What is the minimum difficulty?
The minimum difficulty, when the target is at the maximum allowed value, is 1.

### How soon might I expect to generate a block?

* Any one grinding of the hash stands the same chance of "winning" as any other.  The numbers game is how many attempts your hardware can make per second.
* You need to know the difficulty (above) and your khash/sec rate (reported by the client).
	* [[bitcoin_miners]] has some stats that may help you predict what you could get.
* Visit a calculator or perform the maths yourself,

* Remember it's just probability!  There are no guarantees you will win every N days.
