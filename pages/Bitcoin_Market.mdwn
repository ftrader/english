The **Bitcoin Market** is a [[bitcoin]] [[currency_exchange]] site owned and operated by dwdollar. It supports Moneybookers, [[Pecunix]], and [[Liberty_Reserve]]. Registration is open to the public. Unlike [[MtGox]], exchanges are done directly between individual users, with Bitcoin Market escrowing the bitcoin funds. Quite often, Bitcoin Market trades at higher values than MtGox.


##Use of the Market

Those wishing to use the market must [create an account](https://www.bitcoinmarket.com/process/signup/create/). One registers payment processors through the *Accounts* page. This is a necessary step for trading currency.

In order to trade, one must either open a bid through *my orders*. Bids are made by declaring how much of a given currency you wish to buy and at what price. Bids can be accepted through the *my trades* page.

##History

Trading on the site began February 6th, 2010 (3.1)

A major update to the site occurred in March, 2011.  Among the changes were: smaller minimum trade size, 24 X 7 trading, and some steps to help ensure that payment will be made for trades that execute.

Though the site at one time was used for trading using PayPal as payment method, fraud caused the exchange to discontinue PayPal trading on June 4, 2011 (3.2).

Important information can also be gained from the Bitcoin Market website homepage which shows a graph of the Bitcoin exchange rate (to US Dollars). This data is also offered in the JSON format.
