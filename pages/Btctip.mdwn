Btctip is a service that allows Twitter users to send bitcoins to each other using a tweet. Visitors can log in the website with only their Twitter account and through the site interface, can see their account history, and withdraw and deposit bitcoins. The site was launched in beta on March 12th 2012  (1.1). 

**Green address deposits**

Users can deposit bitcoins into their Btctip account from a MtGox [[green_address]] to have their deposit registered with zero-confirmations in about 30 seconds. Non-green-address deposits take three confirmations, or about 30 minutes, to be registered by the site.

**Sending bitcoins**

The format for sending bitcoins is:

1. btctip [[recipient]] [[amount]] [[unit]]

For example:

1. btctip @BobOnTwitter 10 bitcents

The permitted units are bitcoins, bitcents, and millibits.

The variations of each that are recognized by btctip.com are:

bitcoin: bitcoin, bitcoins and btc

bitcent: bitcent, bitcents, and cbtc

millibit: millibit, millibits, and mbtc

Note that , (comma) is treated the same as . (decimal mark), so for example, 10,2 bitcents will be interpreted as 10.2 bitcents.

A user's tweet can contain other text as well, as long as some segment of it contains the tipping command. 

For example, this would be valid:

Great post! #btctip @BobOnTwitter 10 bitcents!

After btctip.com has registered a user's tweet, the Twitter account @btctip will post a tweet verifying the transaction, in the following format:

@Recipient, you received a [[Amount]] BTC tip from @Sender! Log in with Twitter to btctip.com to claim your bitcoin!
