The note about pool hashrate being largely irrelevant is wrong. The pool hashrate determines variance of your payout. A pool with a large hashrate is more likely to have frequent and predictable payouts. --[ChocoboLee](User:ChocoboLee) 07:51, 11 July 2011 (GMT)

* Largely irrelevant != completely irrelevant. In general, once you get past a certain point (eg, about 150 times your own hashrate), it ceases to make any significant difference. --[Luke-jr](User:Luke-jr) 14:55, 11 July 2011 (GMT)
