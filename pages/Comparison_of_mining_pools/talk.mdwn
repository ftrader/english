The note about pool hashrate being largely irrelevant is wrong. The pool hashrate determines variance of your payout. A pool with a large hashrate is more likely to have frequent and predictable payouts. --[ChocoboLee](User:ChocoboLee) 07:51, 11 July 2011 (GMT)

* Largely irrelevant != completely irrelevant. In general, once you get past a certain point (eg, about 150 times your own hashrate), it ceases to make any significant difference. --[Luke-jr](User:Luke-jr) 14:55, 11 July 2011 (GMT)

## Reconstruction

Aright then luke, how do you think we should do it? The wiki is in need of some kind of remake, its a mess. I thought that would be the best way to do it, but if you have a better idea let me hear it.

* This page seems fine as it is. What problem are you trying to deal with? --[Luke-jr](User:Luke-jr) ([[talk|User_talk:Luke-jr]]) 19:53, 30 September 2012 (GMT)
