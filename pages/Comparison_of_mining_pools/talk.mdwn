Hashrate entries should be automatically fetched every hour or so.

> I agree, but want to add that a 24 hour median value would be a good idea. Not everyone an a specific region is online 24/7. This would even everything out.--[Neptop](User:Neptop) 08:46, 9 June 2011 (GMT)\
> Not everyone has the same daily routines either, so make that at least a week. Pool variation also means it needs to be at least a month. --[Luke-jr](User:Luke-jr) 16:09, 11 October 2011 (GMT)

The note about pool hashrate being largely irrelevant is wrong. The pool hashrate determines variance of your payout. A pool with a large hashrate is more likely to have frequent and predictable payouts. --[ChocoboLee](User:ChocoboLee) 07:51, 11 July 2011 (GMT)

* Largely irrelevant != completely irrelevant. In general, once you get past a certain point (eg, about 150 times your own hashrate), it ceases to make any significant difference. --[Luke-jr](User:Luke-jr) 14:55, 11 July 2011 (GMT)

## Reconstruction

Aright then luke, how do you think we should do it? The wiki is in need of some kind of remake, its a mess. I thought that would be the best way to do it, but if you have a better idea let me hear it. [[!template id=unsigned Tittiez 14:28, 30 September 2012]]

* This page seems fine as it is. What problem are you trying to deal with? --[Luke-jr](User:Luke-jr) ([[talk|User_talk:Luke-jr]]) 19:53, 30 September 2012 (GMT)
