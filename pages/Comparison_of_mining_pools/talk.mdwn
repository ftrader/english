> I agree, but want to add that a 24 hour median value would be a good idea. Not everyone an a specific region is online 24/7. This would even everything out.--[Neptop](User:Neptop) 08:46, 9 June 2011 (GMT)

The note about pool hashrate being largely irrelevant is wrong. The pool hashrate determines variance of your payout. A pool with a large hashrate is more likely to have frequent and predictable payouts. --[ChocoboLee](User:ChocoboLee) 07:51, 11 July 2011 (GMT)
