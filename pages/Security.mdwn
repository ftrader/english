**Security** is the degree of resistance to, or protection from, harm. It applies to any vulnerable and valuable [[asset]], such as a person, dwelling, community, nation, or organization. Security provides a form of protection where a separation is created between the assets and the threat. These separations are generically called controls, and sometimes include changes to the asset or the threat.
