## Intro
While in the recent past it has been risky for sellers to offer this option, some services are now allowing you to buy bitcoins with your credit card. However, that does not mean it is entirely risk free in all markets; if you are from Asia or Africa your funds may be frozen by credit card payment processors for further inspection due to the large amounts of fraud that come from those continents. 

**Note:** If you only want to take advantage of Bitcoin's price volatility you can trade CFDs on Bitcoin via a credit card on sites like [AvaTrade](http://www.ava-trade.co.uk/lp/bitcoin-trading/) or [Plus500](http://99bitcoins.com/plus500). When trading online your capital may be at risk. Trading CFDs is suitable for more experienced traders.
