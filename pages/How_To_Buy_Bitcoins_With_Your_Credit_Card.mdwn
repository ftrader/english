## Intro
While in the recent past it has been risky for sellers to offer this option, some services are now allowing you to buy bitcoins with your credit card. However, that does not mean it is entirely risk free in all markets; if you are from Asia or Africa your funds may be frozen by credit card payment processors for further inspection due to the large amounts of fraud that come from those continents. 

**Note:** If you only want to take advantage of Bitcoin's price volatility you can trade CFDs on Bitcoin via a credit card on sites like [AvaTrade](http://www.ava-trade.co.uk/lp/bitcoin-trading/) or [Plus500](https://99bitcoins.com/plus500).

## Avoiding Scams
Before using any service it is a good idea to look for reviews and feedback from previous customers. This can be done by simply googling the name of the website or company. The bitcointalk forums or reddit are also a good place to find discussions and reviews about services. 

## Scammers
**Do not use, ever!** The following is a list of companies that are very likely or already proven as SCAM. If you decide to list a website here, always provide a reference.

### Bithome
<span style="color:red">Warning: This user is the scammer behind many known sites as bitin, bithome and for sure a couple of unknown scams, too.</span>
[Bithome](https://bithome.co/) scams users by offering to "buy" Bitcoin with PayPal, Skrill, MoneyGram, Western Union and SEPA / Wire transfer. Also users can "sell" Bitcoins, NOT. 

**If you send any money, it will be gone and you will not hear back from them.** In case of PayPal money is collected as "friend+family" payment and can not be charged back.
PayPal fraud team is aware, but did not do anything about it for months (01/2016). Additionally, the site uses Cloudflare and other technologies to cloak its origin. The contact address equals the one of bitin.co Scam.
