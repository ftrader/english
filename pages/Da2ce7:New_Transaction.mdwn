*make new transaction*

*txnumber* is a random string given to every transaction for identification purposes.<br />
*pubkey* is assumed to be owned by the client that preforms the 'readying' of the transition (build > ready states)

States:
*build* this state a transaction doesn't need to fulfil any rules. The user just defines what she wants in the transaction.
*ready* this state is after a client that has (or knows of the), private keys checks the transaction, checking and adding more inputs or change output if necessary.
*done* the transaction has been signed by and all the inputs are vaild.
*submited* the transaction has successfully publicly announced.

**This entire processing is lazy!  Bitcoin will automatically fill-out everything just as it dose at-the-moment with the *readytransaction* stage.**

Please not this draft doesn't include all possible error responses.
