While units in Bitcoin follow the Standard Metric Notation system, this page lists the most commonly used units. These can be written/typed/expressed in any number of ways. From using some form of the prefix, to an abbreviation of both the prefix and adding bit/bitcoin. Bitcoin as a unit of account is commonly written without capitalization.
