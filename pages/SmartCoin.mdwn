Simple Miner Administration for Remote Terminals is a full-blown administration system for miners.

A full load-balanced system that tracks all of the miner instances on a machine, and reports everything on one easy to view screen.  The idea is to spread many miner instances across several GPUs for multiple pools (and even solo!) on one machine (i'm mining to 4 concurrent pools as we speak. If any one of them goes down, the system re-balances its self with any remaining good pools, and my hashing power remains the same).

The author of [[LinuxCoin]] plans to include SmartCoin in that software distribution.
