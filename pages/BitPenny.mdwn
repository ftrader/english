BitPenny was the first [[mining pool|Pooled_mining]] to introduce a fixed-rate, instant-payout model.  The service discontinued service indefinitely as-of April 2, 2011 (1.1).

Each share submitted to BitPenny was worth a fixed (based on current [[difficulty|Difficulty]]) amount of bitcoins.  The user's account was credited immediately upon submission, and the balance was instantly available for withdrawal from the [BitPenny website](http://www.bitpenny.com).  This approach shifted the risks associated with bad luck, cheating, and transaction-reversal [[attacks|Weaknesses]] from the user to the pool operator, resulting in a virtually zero-variance payout curve.

The service was operated for-profit and thus self-insured against variances. (1.2).

The service was first available for beta testing starting February 08, 2011.  The second round of testing began on March 2nd, 2011.
