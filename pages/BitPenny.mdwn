A [[mining pool|Pooled_mining]].

The service is operated for-profit and thus self-insures against variances from the percent of generation proceeds retained (1.1).

The service was available for beta testing starting February 08, 2011.  The service has since been halted for updates and improvements before a second round of testing begins.
