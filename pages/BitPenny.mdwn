BitPenny is the first [[mining pool|Pooled_mining]] to introduce a fixed-rate, instant-payout model.  Each share submitted to BitPenny is worth a fixed (based on current [[difficulty|Difficulty]]) amount of bitcoins.  The user's account is credited immediately upon submission, and the balance is instantly available for withdrawal from the [BitPenny website](http://www.bitpenny.com).  This approach shifts the risks associated with bad luck, cheating, and transaction-reversal [[attacks|Weaknesses]] from the user to the pool operator, resulting in a virtually zero-variance payout curve.

The service is operated for-profit and thus self-insures against variances from the percent of generation proceeds retained over time (1.1).

The service was first available for beta testing starting February 08, 2011.  The second round of testing began on March 2nd, 2011.
