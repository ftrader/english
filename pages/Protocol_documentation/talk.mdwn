I'm adding some hexdumps of messages and data structures and descriptions of how these are interpreted in order to help others understand these protocol and data structures.  It's a bit redundant, so any ideas as to how to remove some of the redundancy while keeping the knowledge accessible are welcome (feel free to make the changes yourself!). -- [X6763](User:X6763)
