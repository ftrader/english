An open-source Bitcoin solution written in Go language (golang).
It can be built for every platform that has a working Go compiler.
It uses a proprietary license, though is free to use for non-commercial purposes.

##Features

Gocoin has a several unique features, that distinguish it from the original bitcoin client.

###Node / Client

* All the unspent outputs are kept in memory, which makes switching between different wallets, as well as checking a balance of any address, relatively fast (few seconds max).
* Allows a user to limit the upload and download network bandwidth used by the client.
* Can be monitored and controlled through a web interface (from a web browser).
* Works with its own implementation of a cold storage wallet.

###Wallet

* For security reasons, it is supposed to be used with a PC that has never been (and will never be) connected to a network.
* The wallet is deterministic and a seed-password based. As long as you can remember the password, there is no need for any backups.
* Additionally it can import private keys from an existing bitcoin wallet (that comes in the base58 format).
* Has very low hardware requirements. Can be run on i.e. Raspberry Pi
* Can generate [Type-2](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=19137.0) deterministic keys/addresses
* Supports signing of P2SH multisig transactions.

###Node-less mode
It is possible to use Gocoin's wallet, without a need to have a running client node.

In such a case the required balance files are fetched with a tool called **FetchBal**, from two popular block explorer services; [[BlockChain.info]] and [[BlockExplorer.com]].

##Requirements
The client node requires 64-bit platform and at least 4GB of system memory. It also requires a file system that can handle files larger than 4GB.

##Limitations

* No GUI, though the online node has web interface
* No IPv6
* No UPnP

##History

Gocoin was written by a single person for a private purposes.
The software's first public release was announced in May 2013 on Bitcointalk forum. (8.1)
