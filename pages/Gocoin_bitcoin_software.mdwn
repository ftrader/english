An open-source Bitcoin solution written in Go language (golang).
It can be built for every platform that has a working Go compiler.
It uses a proprietary license, though is free to use for non-commercial purposes.

##Features

Gocoin has a several unique features, that distinguish it from the original bitcoin client.

###Node

* All the unspent outputs are kept in memory, so switching between different wallets is very fast.
* Allows a user to limit the upload and download network bandwidth used by the client.
* Works with its own implementation of a cold storage wallet.

###Wallet

* For security reasons, it is supposed to be used with a PC that has never been (and will never be) connected to a network.
* The wallet is deterministic and a seed-password based, so as long as you remember the password, you do not need to backup it, ever.
* Additionally you can import private keys for your existing bitcoin wallet.
* Has very low hardware requirements, so you can run it on i.e. Raspberry Pi
* Supports P2SH multisig transactions

##Requirements
The client node requires 64-bit platform and at least 4GB of system memory. It also requires a file system that can handle files larger than 4GB.

##Limitations

* No GUI, though the online node has web interface
* No IPv6
* No UPnP

##History

Gocoin was written by a single person for a private purposes.
The software's first public release was announced in May 2013 on Bitcointalk forum. (7.1)
