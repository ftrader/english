ProtoShares is a coin created by the U.S company [[Invictus_Innovations]].

Owners of PTS will get some stake (10%?) in any future crypto-currency that is launched by Invictus.
Invictus are planning various crypto-currencies that serve different purposes, e.g. [[BitShares]] for a CFD/financial market, [[Keyhotee]] for identitiy management, and more.
