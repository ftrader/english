How 'bout renaming this page "Bitcoin client".  I couldn't find it from Category:Clients because I didn't expect it to begin with "O".  [Klortho](User:Klortho) 04:20, 30 April 2011 (GMT)
>  Strongly disagree. "Bitcoin client" is a generic term that refers to all Bitcoin clients, not just one. If anything, this should be renamed to wxBitcoin or bitcoind. --[Luke-jr](User:Luke-jr) 04:42, 30 April 2011 (GMT)
