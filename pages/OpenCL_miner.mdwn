An **OpenCL miner** is a bitcoin miner that uses the [OpenCL framework](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenCL) to perform the hashing computations. When used with a modern GPU, this can produce hash rates orders of magnitude higher than what can be achieved with a CPU. Hashing on a GPU requires an OpenCL or CUDA compatible graphics card.

The first open source OpenCL bitcoin miner was created by m0mchil (1.1). Subsequently another miner based on m0mchil's was created in Java by Diablo-D3. (1.2)

See the [[Mining_Hardware_Comparison]] page for detailed statistics on the hash rates that can be achieved with various hardware.
