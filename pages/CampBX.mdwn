A bitcoin [[currency_exchange]]/trading platform site.

Camp BX is an Atlanta-based platform where you can buy and sell Bitcoins for US Dollars in real-time. Any buy or sell order that you place is matched against a database of other orders. If a perfect match is found, a Bitcoin-to-USD trade is executed instantly. If there are no matching orders at the price you specified, then your order can remain open for up to 31 days. To maintain fairness in trading, Camp BX have taken a purely-platform approach and they are never a counter-party to any trade.


This platform was designed from the ground up with stability and security as top priorities, and became the first Bitcoin website to obtain Payment Card Industry (PCI) certification and the McAfee Secure seal of confidence on June 28th, 2011.


Camp BX is also the first Bitcoin platform to bring advanced features like Margin Trading and Short-selling, and have several more exciting and innovative features in pipeline.


There are no fees required to open a Camp BX account, so everyone can sign-up and try out the site.


This platform is operated by BulBul Investments LLC which is a corporate entity registered with the State of Georgia, and is headquartered in Atlanta at 2002 Summit Blvd #300, Atlanta, GA 30319.

##Trading

Camp BX is among the first Bitcoin exchanges to offer both market orders as well as limit orders.  Market orders get filled regardless of the price. 

Camp BX provides Quick Trades for casual Bitcoin users, where you enter the quantity and the desired price for buying or selling Bitcoins, and execute the trade. All prices entered are "Limit" prices, where the platform will find a matching trade at given price or better.

This exchange also is among the first to offer Advanced Trading options such as Fill-or-Kill and All-or-Nothing.  Fill-or-Kill means that if the order cannot immediately be matched, it will be cancelled automatically.  All-or-Nothing means that the order will match only when the entire quantity in the order can be traded.
Advanced Trades implement trading functionality described in the following SEC Investor Bulletin as closely as possible:

Additionally, though currently disabled, the exchange's trading site refers to margin trading (buying on margin and shorting) -- something that no other exchange has offered yet.

###Fees

Trades on the exchange incur a commission (fee) of 0.55%.

##History

First mention on the site was on June 5th, 2011 (12.1).
