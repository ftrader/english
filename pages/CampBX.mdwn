##Trading

Camp BX is among the first Bitcoin exchanges to offer both market orders as well as limit orders.  Market orders get filled regardless of the price. 

This exchange also is among the first to offer options such as Fill-or-Kill and All-or-Nothing.  Fill-or-Kill means that if the order cannot immediately be matched, it will be cancelled automatically.  All-or-Nothing means that the order will match only when the entire quantity in the order can be traded.

Additionally, though currently disabled, the exchange's trading site refers to margin trading (buying on margin and shorting) -- something that no other exchange has offered yet.

###Fees

Trades on the exchange incur a commission (fee) of 0.55%.

##History

First mention on the site was on June 5th, 2011 (12.1).
