A **mining rig** is a computer system used to mine for bitcoins.  The rig might be a dedicated miner where it was procured, built and operated specifically for mining bitcoin or it could otherwise be a computer that fills other needs, such as performing as a gaming system, and is used for mining only on a part-time basis.
