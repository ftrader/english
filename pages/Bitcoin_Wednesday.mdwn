Bitcoin Wednesday: First Wednesday of the Month


Bitcoin Wednesday is a global meetup event scheduled for the first Wednesday of every month.

The [genesis](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=248358.msg2635123#msg2635123) of this event was a forum post highlighting the coincidental synchronicity of nearly a dozen local bitcoin meetups.

If you are a member of any of the [local bitcoin meetups](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Meetups), you should make every effort to promote a special meeting for Bitcoin Wednesday.
