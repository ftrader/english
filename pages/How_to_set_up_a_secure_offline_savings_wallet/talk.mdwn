This isn't secure. The procedure for sending bitcoins involves connecting the offline wallet to the internet. This should not be necessary, and carries some risk (e.g. the livecd could be compromised or contain a trojen, or the O/S could contain a vulnerability). It should be possible to create the transaction offline, and then execute it on an online system. --[Rebroad](User:Rebroad) ([[talk|User_talk:Rebroad]]) 14:27, 23 December 2012 (GMT)

Is this page a joke?  How is sending the wallet.dat via Email to 5 people "secure" and what is all this business about Wuala; uploading your wallet.dat to a online service....wtf?  All the stuff about Wuala and Email should be removed.
