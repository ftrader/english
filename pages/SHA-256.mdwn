SHA-256 is a member of the SHA-2 cryptographic hash functions designed by the NSA. SHA stands for Secure Hash Algorithm. Cryptographic hash functions are mathematical operations run on digital data; by comparing the computed "hash" (the output from execution of the algorithm) to a known and expected hash value, a person can determine the data's integrity.  A one-way hash can be generated from any piece of data, but the data cannot be generated from the hash.

SHA-256 is used in several different parts of the Bitcoin network:

1. [[Mining]] uses SHA-256 as the [[Proof_of_work]] algorithm.
1. SHA-256 is used in the [[creation of bitcoin addresses|Technical_background_of_version_1_Bitcoin_addresses#How_to_create_Bitcoin_Address]] to improve security and privacy.
