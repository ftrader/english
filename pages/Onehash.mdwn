## Overview
[OneHash](https://www.onehash.com) was introduced back in 2014 during FIFA World Cup in Brazil as a user-friendly bitcoin betting platform made by and for sports and bitcoin enthusiasts. The design is very neat and its usability is undisturbed by unnecessary elements like adverts or banners. The way the platform works is really simple - you choose your bet, place bitcoins and just wait for the match final result.
	
OneHash is a mutual betting service which means that it is not a traditional bookie but more of a broker between its users. Since players bet against each other, not against OneHash, the betting multiplier changes dynamically depending on the amount of bitcoins in the bank, and also on the bet amount made by other users. 

Bitcoins circulate between users only, allowing for mutual betting undisturbed by anyone. Itâ€™s exciting because the multiplier depends only on bets already placed and changes dynamically.
