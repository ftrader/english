## Overview
[OneHash](https://www.onehash.com)is a mutual bitcoin betting platform meaning that users bet only against each other as opposed to playing against the bookmaker in more classical approach. Bitcoins circulate between users only, allowing for mutual betting undisturbed by anyone. Multipliers change dynamically depending only on users choices often making the final odds higher than competitions propositions. The service is available without any form of registration making it easy to use and as private as the Bitcoin network itself. There’s a wide range of sports to choose from as well as special events including presidential elections and pop culture events like The Oscars, Grammy’s or Golden Globes. 

OneHash also provides an affiliate program for its users enabling them to earn even more bitcoins. All they have to do is set up their referral link and start earning. The team also provides tips&tricks about affiliate marketing and making most of it in a designated [BitcoinTalk thread](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1358615.0). 

The platform has a well established presence in bitcoin media, gets strong reviews and is known for being where the users want them to be which lead to profiles on Facebook, Twitter, Reddit and a BitcoinTalk thread where people can find fresh news about OneHash and ask any questions they may have.
