A block is valid if it obeys all of the [[Protocol_rules]]; otherwise it is invalid.

* Clients **will ignore invalid blocks** when determining which chain is difficultywise-longest.
* Mining clients **will not build on top of** invalid blocks.
* Clients **will not propagate** invalid blocks (or invalid transactions).
