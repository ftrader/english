##Resolving
I think the map should resolve (PTR/rDNS) the IPs it finds for statistic reasons. It shouldn't hurt, unless if it's applied in mass (see below).
*Curious corner:* I am running a resolver I wrote on mIRC script which takes IPs off KML placemark names and resolves them. It's at 33% parsing the current map, running for 1-2 hours or so.
