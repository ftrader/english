A CPU/GPU miner for Windows that performs [[Pooled_Mining]].  This miner has SSE2 optimizations and differs from jgarzik's [[cpuminer]].  This miner was created by [Ufasoft](http://ufasoft.com).

Originally a CPU Miner, a in March 2011 the ability to also perform as an [[GPU_miner]] was added. It has two GPU implmentations: OpenCL and AMD CAL API (intermediate assembly language for GPU). (1.1).
