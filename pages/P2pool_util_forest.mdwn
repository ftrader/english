This contains code for tracking shares.
##Class Tracker
Number of dictionaries that store the shares in various ways to allow fast access.

1. shares (hash->share) Since share contains parent share allows you to link to previous shares all the way to the tail.
1. reverse_shares (delta.tail->set of share_hashes) Allows you to link share to the next share that came after it all the way to the head.
1. deltas (share_hash -> delta, ref)
1. reverse_deltas (ref -> set of share_hashes)
1. delta_refs (ref -> delta)
1. reverse_delta_refs ( delta.tail -> ref)

**what are deltas???** I have not got my head round this code at all!
###Method add
