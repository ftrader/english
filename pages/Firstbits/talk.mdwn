## Reverting unback claims

Reverting [claims](https://en.bitcoin.it/w/index.php?title=Firstbits&action=historysubmit&diff=24974&oldid=19697) that

	Firstbits is generally considered to be a bad idea because it encourages transaction spam.
	This position is held by most, if not all, of Bitcoin developers.

"transaction spam" is not a generally accepted meaningful term - any transaction is legitimate. Certainly such a strong claim that presumes to speak on behalf of "most or all of the devs" must be backed by evidence.

Luke-Jr, please do not revert this without a discussion, and do not add the claim with a prefix such as "According to some".
