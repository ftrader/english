> Unfortunately there are not any posts on bitcointalk.org except users with 1 post. I can write the same as you wrote but the opposite, as of yet there's exactly zero evidence that I'm running a con, and it is as true as your sentence. If i was a scam, then there would be at least one person reporting on it after running the service for 9 months? Why is a 17 pages long thread with only positive feedback not trustworthy? There are more threads but its all on forums on Tor, no one is saying its a scam, search the internet and look for anyone saying i stole any bitcoins or that the mixer doesn't properly mix the coins and leave 0 taint? Here are some more examples on different forums with different established users discussing Bitcoin Blender in different contexts:

> I hope someone knowledgeable would post on bitcointalk.org that they are using/used Bitcoin Blender eventually, it should have happened after running the service for 9 months without any problems, but it has unfortunately not happened yet. I am trying to point traffic to that bitcointalk.org thread by having a link to it from my site for using as discussion but its mostly darknet users so they cant post on bitcointalk.org.

> Why am i suddenly being treated as guilty after the page has been up here for 8 months without any scam reports or problems? I have announced my service in the best way I can, without spam or lying, i even my self had the "Caution: This service is operating anonymously. Use at your own discretion." message on the page, would a scammer put that on?

> I'm not calling you a scammer here; I just don't have any proof that you're not. While it is also true that I have no proof that you *are*, I'd like to be careful. The number of bitcoin mixer scams that have been left unchecked on this wiki is nearly heartbreaking. I've helplessly watched as people lost large portions of their hard earned savings, and I want to do my best to assure that it doesn't happen to anyone else. I would suggest asking your returning users to post to your BitcoinTalk thread (assuming they are at least full members). I will then reinstate the page and protect the links section to prevent fraudsters from trying to impersonate you. [Taras](User:Taras) ([[talk|User_talk:Taras]]) 16:36, 16 September 2014 (UTC)
