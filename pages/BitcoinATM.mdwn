A BitcoinATM is a specialized piece of equipment that functions similar to a traditional ATM, but with added functionality that makes it function more like a physical exchange. There are multiple types machines, but they are generally broken down as 1 way or 2 way machines. 1 way machines, or Kiosks, allow for the insertion of cash and withdrawal of Bitcoin only. 2 way machines generally function as a full exchange, allowing for conversion between both fiat to bitcoin or bitcoin to fiat.

Different BitcoinATM manufacturers and operators choose different levels of AML/KYC requirements depending on their own needs and the jurisdiction of the physical placement of the BitcoinATM.
