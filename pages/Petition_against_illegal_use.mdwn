## Definitions

"Illegal activity" is defined as infringement of civil or criminal law in the jurisdiction of the person acting. For example, if it is legal to use/abuse marijuana in JurisdictionX, then it is NOT considered to be illegal activity for someone in JurisdictionX. On the other hand, if it is illegal in JurisdictionY, it IS considered illegal activity to anyone under that jurisdiction.
