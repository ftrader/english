Bitcoin Co. Ltd. is the first registered company in Thailand offering bitcoin services such as exchange and merchant services.

In 2013 the company got considerable international news coverage when the Bank of Thailand advised them to stop Bitcoin services in Thailand.

The company has since resumed operations in Thailand after a softening of position by the BoT.
