A monthly lottery where one winner was be chosen at the end of the month.  The winner earns 80% of the amounts wagered.

The site was announced on February 20th, 2011 (1.1).  The first and last draw was on March 4th, 2011 (1.2)

##Criticism

Thought the site's instructions say the winnner will be chosen by a random number generator, there is no independent verification that this in fact is what occurs.  The operator keeps 10% of the amounts wagered, and another 10% goes to a charity that has not been identified.  Returns of 80% or 90% even might not be considered to be competitive for an online lottery.
