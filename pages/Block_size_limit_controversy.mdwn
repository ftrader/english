[[!template id=current]][[!template id=see_also Scalability FAQ]]
[[Block]]s are limited to 1MB in size. Miners can mine blocks up to the 1MB fixed limit, but any block larger than 1MB is invalid. This limit cannot be modified without a hard fork. To prevent Bitcoin from temporarily or permanently splitting into separate payment networks ("altcoins"), hard forks require adoption by nearly all [[economically active|Full_node#Economic_strength]] full nodes.

## Arguments in favor of increasing the blocksize

* More transactions per second
* The crash landing (2.1) scenario estimates that as transaction numbers exceed the blocksize limit on a regular basis, bitcoin nodes may crash and therefore the network could be seriously disrupted.
* Rising fees due to the low blocksize limit will make bitcoin unattractive and will stop or even reverse global adoption, in turn leading to less interest, less investment, less development, less support and consequently also more centralisation and an unstable network.
* As blocks and the network get congested, transaction processing gets less reliable and may result in timeouts and the need to re-broadcast transactions with a higher fee, leading to a bad user experience.
* Off-chain solutions are not yet ready to take off the load from the main blockchain.

## Unclear Arguments

* Increased blocksize will leave space for extensions like Mastercoin, Counterparty, etc.
	* Neutral: Bitcoin competitors will have lower fees
	* Negative: Bitcoin full nodes are forced to use more resources that don't support Bitcoin
* Faster confirmation times with lower fees required
	* Positive: Bitcoin users pay lower fees
	* Negative: It will continue to be cheap to spam transactions such as Satoshi Dice bets
	* Negative: Fees cannot be zero eventually in order to secure the mining ecosystem

## Arguments in opposition to increasing the blocksize

* A hard fork requires waiting for sufficient consensus.
* Risk of catastrophic consensus failure (4.1)[[!template id=clarification_needed]]
* An emergency hard fork that can achieve consensus can be deployed on a short time period if needed. (4.2)
* Orphan rate amplification, more reorgs and double-spends due to slower propagation speeds.
* European/American pools at more of a disadvantage compared to the Chinese pools[[!template id=why]]
* "Congestion" concerns can be solved with mempool improvements including transaction eviction.
* No amount of max block size would support all the world's future transactions on the main blockchain (various types of off-chain transactions are the only long-term solution)
* Fast block propagation is either not clearly viable, or (eg, IBLT) creates centralised controls.
* A low blocksize limit encourages higher transactions fees to incentivize miners ("let a fee market develop")

### Damage to decentralization

* Larger blocks make full nodes more expensive to operate.
* Therefore, larger blocks lead to less hashers running full nodes, which leads to centralized entities having more power, which makes Bitcoin require more trust, which weakens Bitcoins value proposition.
* Bitcoin is only useful if it is decentralized because centralization requires trust. Bitcoins value proposition is trustlessness.
* The larger the hash-rate a single miner controls, the more centralized Bitcoin becomes and the more trust using Bitcoin requires.
* Running your own full node while mining rather than giving another entity the right to your hash-power decreases the hash-rate of large miners. Those who have hash-power are able to control their own hash power if and only if they run a full node.
* Less individuals who control hash-power will run full nodes if running one becomes more expensive (5.1).

## Entities positions
Positions below are based on a suggested fixed block size increase to 20MiB.  Positions against these larger blocks do not necessarily imply that they are against an increase in general, and may instead support a smaller and/or gradual increase.
