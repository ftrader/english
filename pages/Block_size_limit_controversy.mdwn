## Argument in favor of increasing the blocksize

* Bigger blocks (more transactions per second)
## Argument in opposition of increasing the blocksize

* Risk of catastrophic consensus failure
### Damage to decentalization

* Bitcoin is only useful if it is decentralized because centralization requires trust. Bitcoins value proposition is trustlessness.

* The larger the hash-rate a single miner controls, the more centralized Bitcoin becomes and the more trust using Bitcoin requires.

* Running your own full node while mining rather than giving another entity the right to your hash-power decreases the hash-rate of large miners. Those who control hash-power are able to control their own hash power if and only if they run a full node.

* Less individuals who control hash-power will run full nodes if running one becomes more expensive.

* Larger blocks leads to more expensive full nodes.

* Therefore, larger blocks lead to less hashers running full nodes, which leads to centralized entities having more power, which makes Bitcoin require more trust, which weakens Bitcoins value proposition.
