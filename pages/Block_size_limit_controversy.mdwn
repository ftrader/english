[[!template id=current]][[!template id=see_also Scalability FAQ]]
[[Block]]s are limited to 1MB in size. Miners can mine blocks up to the 1MB fixed limit, but any block larger than 1MB is invalid. This limit cannot be modified without a hard fork. To prevent Bitcoin from temporarily or permanently splitting into separate payment networks ("altcoins"), hard forks require adoption by nearly all [[economically active|Full_node#Economic_strength]] full nodes.

## Arguments in favor of increasing the blocksize

* More transactions per second
* Off-chain solutions are not yet ready to take off the load from the main blockchain.

## Unclear Arguments

* Increased blocksize will leave space for extensions like Mastercoin, Counterparty, etc.
	* Neutral: Bitcoin competitors will have lower fees
	* Negative: Bitcoin full nodes are forced to use more resources that don't support Bitcoin
* Small blocks eventually will require higher fees for fast confirmations.
	* Positive: It will no longer be cheap to spam transactions such as Satoshi Dice bets
	* Positive: Fees will not be zero. This is eventually a necessity in order to incentivize miners and secure the mining ecosystem
	* Negative: Bitcoin may look unattractive to new users with high fees
	* Negative: High fees may stop or reverse global adoption, investment, development, support and centralization[[!template id=clarification_needed]]
	* Negative: Bitcoin users pay higher fees

## Arguments in opposition to increasing the blocksize

* A hard fork requires waiting for sufficient consensus.
* Risk of catastrophic consensus failure (4.1)[[!template id=clarification_needed]]
* An emergency hard fork that can achieve consensus can be deployed on a short time period if needed. (4.2)
* Orphan rate amplification, more reorgs and double-spends due to slower propagation speeds.
* European/American pools at more of a disadvantage compared to the Chinese pools[[!template id=why]]
* "Congestion" concerns can be solved with mempool improvements including transaction eviction.
* No amount of max block size would support all the world's future transactions on the main blockchain (various types of off-chain transactions are the only long-term solution)
* Fast block propagation is either not clearly viable, or (eg, IBLT) creates centralised controls.
* A low blocksize limit encourages higher transactions fees to incentivize miners ("let a fee market develop"). Counter-argument: [A Transaction Fee Market Exists Without a Block Size Limit](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/43331625/feemarket.pdf)

### Damage to decentralization

* Larger blocks make full nodes more expensive to operate.
* Therefore, larger blocks lead to less hashers running full nodes, which leads to centralized entities having more power, which makes Bitcoin require more trust, which weakens Bitcoins value proposition.
* Bitcoin is only useful if it is decentralized because centralization requires trust. Bitcoins value proposition is trustlessness.
* The larger the hash-rate a single miner controls, the more centralized Bitcoin becomes and the more trust using Bitcoin requires.
* Running your own full node while mining rather than giving another entity the right to your hash-power decreases the hash-rate of large miners. Those who have hash-power are able to control their own hash power if and only if they run a full node.
* Less individuals who control hash-power will run full nodes if running one becomes more expensive (5.1).

##Proposals
###BIP 100
Periodically change the limit based on observed block size, but never go larger than 32MB.
###BIP 101
[[!template id=seealso Bitcoin XT]]
Increase to 8 MB on January 11, 2016, and double the limit every two years.
###BIP 102
Increase to 2 MB on November 11, 2015.
###BIP 103
Increase by 17.7% annually until 2063.

## Entities positions
Positions below are based on a suggested fixed block size increase to 20MiB.  Positions against these larger blocks do not necessarily imply that they are against an increase in general, and may instead support a smaller and/or gradual increase.

Changing a constant is not the hard-part.  The hard part is validating a plan and the other factors that go into it.  It's not a free choice it is a security/scalability tradeoff.
