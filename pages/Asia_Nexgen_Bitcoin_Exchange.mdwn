****[Bitcoin Exchange](ANX) is a trading platform for buying and selling Bitcoin, Litecoin and Namecoin in AUD, CAD, CHF, EUR, GBP, HKD, JPY, NZD, SGD and USD currencies . The exchange was established in 2013 and is legally registered and based in Hong Kong.  Asia Nexgen was one of the first Bitcoin exchanges in Hong Kong to be issued with a Money Services Operator (MSO) license by the Hong Kong Customs and Excise Department.  The trading engine is built upon the LMAX Disruptor technology used by banks for their foreign currency exchange (FX) trading.  The engine was designed to handle high volume, high throughput, and low latency trading.  The exchange has a favorable reputation for promptly processing deposit and withdrawal requests on a weekday daily basis.<P>

ANX originally offered only a single product, namely ANXBTC to satisfy customers whom were wanting to purchase and sell Bitcoins via a simple and efficient service with fast and varied payment processing options.  

On 20 January 2014, owing to the requests from their customers ANXPRO was released to production.  ANXPRO was designed for the advanced user and specializes in Altcoins, Algos and Performance.  The platform provides a professional trading facility with all major currency and crypto pairs.  ANXPRO is the only crypto-currency exchange in the world that facilitates Altcoin trading in no less than 10 fiat currencies.
