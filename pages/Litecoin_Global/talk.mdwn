This is a Bitcoin wiki, not scamcoin. This is off-topic and spam. --[Luke-jr](User:Luke-jr) ([[talk|User_talk:Luke-jr]]) 21:01, 9 August 2013 (GMT)

>  Alt-coins are on-topic, just like they are on-topic on the [bitcoin stackexchange](http://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/help/on-topic) ("on topic: a cryptocurrency or technology derived directly from Bitcoin such as Namecoin"). If you think alts are off-topic on the wiki, please show evidence to support your opinion.
