On July 2nd, 2013, xCrowd announced their intention to produce a custom Bitcoin mining [[ASIC]]. (1.1) (1.2)

Although not formally canceled, no substantial post was made to its announcement thread by xCrowd since August 26th, 2013. (1.3)

As of June 6th, 2014, the original [[BitcoinTalk_Forum]] account used by xCrowd appears to be in use by a different person, based on the changes in writing style and interests. (1.4)
