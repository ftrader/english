**btcex** is a Russian [[bitcoin]] [[currency_exchange]] site. They trade Russian Rubles, Yandex Money, Webmoney, Euros and Japanese Yen for bitcoin.

The site has been closed on 12 May 2011, claimed to be due to a user claiming irregularities in trading and threatening with legal action.

The site re-opened in early June, with 5/6 (83%) of each user's bitcoins missing (eg. if one had an account balance of 120BTC before they went down, only 20BTC were left) . Their support remain silent.
