**btcex** is a [[bitcoin]] [[currency_exchange]] site for exchanging between [[namecoin]] currency (NMC) and bitcoins (BTC) and [[Liberty_Reserve]] (LRUSD) against each digital currency as well (BTC/USD and NMC/USD).

Originally, the site traded Russian Rubles, Yandex Money, Webmoney, Euros and Japanese Yen for bitcoin.

##History

The site closed temporarily, beginning 12 May 2011 after claiming that a user claimed irregularities in trading and threatened legal action.  The exchange re-opened in early June, with 5/6 (83%) of each user's bitcoins missing (eg. if one had an account balance of 120BTC before they went down, only 20BTC were left). Their support remain silent.
