##FAQ
Q: Why do I sometimes do not get the data with BTCGuild and on the top of the screen appears "Too often".<br />
A: MTC Guild let get API not more than once per minute. If you frequently access to the API in the program "Mining Explorer", next to the course MtGox, displayed a red label "Too often".

Q: Why is there no field roundduration in the pool information http://pool.mkalinin.ru/api.php .<br />
A: There is no field Roundduration , because it displays the current time UTC +0, and not the duration of the round.

Q: Why is the information about the workers of the pool http://pool.itzod.ru not displayed?<br />
A: The pool http://pool.itzod.ru gives the information only about the active workers. If there are no workers then there is nothing to give.
