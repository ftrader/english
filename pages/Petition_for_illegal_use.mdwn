## Rationale

None of us have consented to being taxed. At no point were we given an opt-out. Taxes are taken from us under the threat of violence (since you will be taken away and locked up in a cage if you dissent in the vast majority of countries). Many of us pay for things which we emphatically disagree with because we have no control over where our contributions go.

Thus, not paying tax is a valid form of dissent.

## Text

We, the undersigned, are in support of dissent in regards to governments' claims to the resources we work hard for.
We encourage people to read, learn about the history of societies, think and come to their own conclusions.

## Signatures

Since our position is fringe and may have serious repercussions, please limit these signatures to just your first name and last initial, unless you live in international waters or do not care for your safety.
