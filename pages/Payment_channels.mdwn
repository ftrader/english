A Payment Channel is an off-blockchain solution for facilitating trustless multiple fee-less transaction.

Two parties can establish a channel (a one time time consuming operation) by exchanging a series of off protocol messages. Once that channel is established, the parties can easily send arbitrarily small transactions across this channel, without incurring the usual transaction fees used in the Bitcoin protocol. This is accomplished by having a series of transactions, each replacing and updating the previous transactions.

Payment channels were discussed [as early as 2011](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=25786.0), and first [implemented in bitcoinj](https://bitcoinj.github.io/working-with-micropayments). [[Lightning_Network]] is an evolution of this concept.
