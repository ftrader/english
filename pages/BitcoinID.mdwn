A Bitcoin address ownership verification method.  This service is intended to be useful to organizations that list a static Bitcoin address, such as is commonly seen when on the website when soliciting donations.

The problem being solved is that should the site be compromised or some other reason there is currently no way to verify that funds sent to the bitcoin address displayed will truly be delivered to the intended recipient.

This service was launched on April 27, 2011 (1.1)
