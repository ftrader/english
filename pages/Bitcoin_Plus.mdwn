Bitcoin Plus is a [[Browser_Bitcoin_Miner]] written in Java. The miner is initiated by the end user, but is also embeddable in webpages, much like [[Bitp.it]]

##Overview

The user registers an account, then is prompted to start mining. Mining is paid on a pay-per-share basis, with 3% taken by the pool operators. The site suggests that users invite their friends to mine with them, and allows users to embed java miners on their websites to create a [[Distributed Miner|Distributed_Miners]].

The UI provides features which seem to be exclusive to the site, such as a prediction of the time it will take to calculate one share.

This miner is a [[Cpu_Miner]]
