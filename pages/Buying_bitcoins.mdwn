##Market Exchanges

Market exchanges are those in which buy orders are matched with sell orders, so the price offered depends on the market.   If a service quotes a price then it is not operating a [market](http://bitcoincharts.com/markets) but instead is a broker that buys and/or sells coins.  Those exchanges are found in the list of [[fixed-rate exchanges|Buying_bitcoins#Fixed_Rate_Exchanges_.26_Others]].

Exchanges are listed in alphabetical order.

##Physical Bitcoins

Physical Bitcoins are bearer tokens that have an embedded redeemable digital bitcoin value if torn open.  While they are somewhat expensive if bought purely for the digital bitcoins, they are relatively easy to get, because they can be purchased with PayPal or credit card - payment methods typically not accepted for pure digital bitcoin purchases.
