One issue currently facing a newcomer to bitcoin is, how do I get some? While there is the [[bitcoin_faucet]] that can get you started with a small fraction of a coin, when getting larger amounts the user faces an abundance of choice. This page will cut through the clutter, and help direct you to the right exchanger for your needs.

##Large amounts

For large amounts of bitcoin (USD 1000 or more), you probably would get the best rate if you deposit funds via bank wire, ACH, Euro bank transfer, or via [[Liberty_Reserve]] into a major exchange.
