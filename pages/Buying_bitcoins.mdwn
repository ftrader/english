##Physical Bitcoins

Physical Bitcoins are bearer tokens that have an embedded redeemable digital bitcoin value if torn open.  While they are somewhat expensive if bought purely for the digital bitcoins, they are relatively easy to get, because they can be purchased with PayPal or credit card - payment methods typically not accepted for pure digital bitcoin purchases.
