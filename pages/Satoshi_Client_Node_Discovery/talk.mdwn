###Information about how onlynet=tor configured do initial node discovery=
I am missing information about how onlynet=tor configured nodes do initial node discovery. I heard something about IPv6-DNS-encoded Onion addresses. I got it only working with temporarily adding "addnode=bpdlwholl7rnkrkw.onion" (from the fallback node wiki page) with node version 0.8.6
