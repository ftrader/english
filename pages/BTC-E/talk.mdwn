## Vandalism

There are serious problems, we should do something against Luke-jr's **stupid** trolling. He provides no proofs for shitty statements and performing vandalism actions. 

In fact, why should we trust him? Because he is Luke-jr? Seriously, I don't care, even If he was Satoshi or God. 

Luke, if you underestimate himself, you need to stop this shit and do something more valuable for community.
