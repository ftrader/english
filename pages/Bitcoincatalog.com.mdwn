## The Directory

BitcoinCatalog's primary objective is to provide the Bitcoin community with a definitive directory of sites that either accept Bitcoins for goods and services or offer Bitcoin-related information, software or currency exchange. BitcoinCatalog is organized into categories to make it easy to find whatever one is looking for and to help people discover whatever they are looking for in the Bitcoin community all around the world.

Adding your site to the directory is absolutely free, so if you accept Bitcoins or have a Bitcoin-related site, you can add it to the directory. There are clear directions for adding your site [here](http://bitcoincatalog.com/policies/getting-listed).

### Information & Resources

In addition, BitcoinCatalog has other areas of the site to help bring together resources and tools to help the Bitcoin community keep up with all the latest news and information surrounding Bitcoins. There are news feeds, blogs and links to other informative sites. BitcoinCatalog encourages visitors to submit their articles and commentaries.

### Community

BitcoinCatalog has also built a Facebook-like social network for the Bitcoin [community](http://bitcoincatalog.com/news-feeds/home). Everyone that registers gets a free profile so they can get to know others from around the globe, upload galleries, write blogs and create or join user groups. Bitcoin enthusiasts can also network and chat with other members. In addition to the social community, they offer a [forum](http://bitcoincatalog.com/forum/main-forum/categories) where people can seek out answers to Bitcoin-related questions.
