Bitcopia's philosophy is that when it comes to buying and selling bitcoins:

1.   Instant quotes should be given and honored.<br>
2.   Third party payments should be an option, not a requirement.<br>
3.   Bitcoin transactions should be offered in an anonymous manner.<br>

Instant quotes based on real time Mt. Gox prices are the backbone of our philosophy. When you place an order, you know exactly what you're going to get and when you're going to get it. All transactions are made as anonymous as possible and can be completed in cash.
