**Bitcoin Sentiment Index (BSI)**, a financial index that collects user opinions on bitcoin that are published on internet blogs, [[IRC_channels]] and on social networks such as Twitter and Facebook. These opinions are analyzed by an computer linguistic engine to recognize the emotional undertone behind every opinion. The Bitcoin Sentiment Index aggregates all these emotions and reflects the prevailing mood investors have towards bitcoin. If more positive emotions are associated with bitcoin the BSI will rise. If feelings towards bitcoin are mainly negative the BSI declines.
