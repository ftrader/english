## Provably Fair

* All games are provably fair - the outcome of each game is the result of two secrets.
* The server generates a new server secret before each play. This secret is hashed and displayed to the player.
* The player provides a client secret. By combining both secrets the result of the game is computed.
* It is impossible for the server to cheat because the client secret is still unknown while the server secret cannot be changed anymore.
Since the player knows the hash of the server secret before each play and can use a client secret at will, the play is actually a mathematical challenge and not random. If the player can solve the hash every play can be won highest, therefor technically there is no act of random involved.
