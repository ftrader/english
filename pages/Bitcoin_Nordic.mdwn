An exchange that features a variety of funding and withdrawal methods with an emphasis on the Nordic / Scandinavian regions.

##Buy

* Bank Transfer - Domestic (Denmark), SEPA (European Union) or international wire transfers to our Danish bank account.
* Cash or check by mail or in-person deposit

##Sell

Bitcoins can be sold at the exchange.  The rate they are exchanged at is based on the market price at [[MtGox]] less a certain percentage for the fee.  The sell trade occurs within 24 hours but the schedule shows withdrawals occurring just once a week.

##History
This service was announced on April 02, 2012 (4.1).

On May 30, 2012 the service discontinued accepting credit card after its merchant processing partner, eWire, severed the relationship citing pressure placed by the VISA / Mastercard "duopoly" (4.2).
