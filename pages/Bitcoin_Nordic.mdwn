##History
This service was announced on April 02, 2012 (13.1).

On May 30, 2012 the service discontinued accepting credit card after its merchant processing partner, eWire, severed the relationship citing pressure placed by the VISA / Mastercard "duopoly" (13.2).

On July 14, 2012 it was announced that the cash network CashU was now supported as a method for purchasing bitcoins (13.3).
