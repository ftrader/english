What is the policy regarding addresses which are not altcoins but which relate to protocols being built on top of bitcoin? I think there is value in some kind of registry for such protocols to prevent address clashes, and help users know the purpose of different addresses. But I don't want to overstep if that's not the purpose of this page.

* I'm not sure what you mean by that. Altcoins abusing bitcoin's blockchain are still altcoins. Also note that the version byte is for a version, not a namespace. --[Luke-jr](User:Luke-jr) ([[talk|User_talk:Luke-jr]]) 20:43, 7 July 2014 (UTC)
