### Selling Electronics for Bitcoin
The Bitcoin Store is an electronics website that only accepts Bitcoin. The store was created in 2012 by Roger Ver. (3.1) With more than half a million products listed, this store a real merchant presence to the Bitcoin economy. The Bitcoin Store is competing with NewEgg and Amazon by using Bitcoin to provide a competitive advantage. Because of Bitcoin's low-risk nature, the Bitcoin Store is able to undercut competitor pricing and hopefully, as Ver puts it, "to put pressure on existing merchants to accept Bitcoin in order to be able to match our prices."
