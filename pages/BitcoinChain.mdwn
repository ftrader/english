[Bitcoinchain.com](http://bitcoinchain.com/) is an analytics and monitoring platform that provides both live statistics and historical data within [[Bitcoin]] ecosystem: Blockchain Explorer, Exchange Markets and Mining Pools. 

Launched in January 2013, the platform provides Block Explorer Service which allows for viewing detailed information about bitcoin addresses, transactions and blocks. BitcoinChain.com also contains data on Bitcoin price and live trades from largest stock exchanges such as OKCoin, Kraken, Bitfinex, Coinbase, Bitstamp and others. Besides, there is a mining pool data block that includes mining pool features, timeline statistics, current hashrate and reward specification.

Additionally, the platform is full of in-depth charts which can be customized by multiple technical indicators and time frame option. 
Not the whole functional is realized right now. A bunch of brand new bitcoin related ideas in plans, so closely follow the updates.
