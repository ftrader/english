A Perl module which interfaces with the Legacy [[Mt. Gox API|MtGox#API]].

This [[open source|tags/Open_Source]] tool is useful to merchants as it helps determine "market clearing rate".  This technique is needed because the number of units offered at the "best bid" or "best ask" are inadequate for a trade of size to execute.  Thus the market clearing rate determines the weighted price for the entire trade to execute.

The module was written by the operator of [[CoinPal]] and [[CoinCard]] and was announced on February 9, 2011 (1.1)
