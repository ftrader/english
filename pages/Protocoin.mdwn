From its [documentation](http://protocoin.readthedocs.org/en/v0.1/):

"Protocoin is pure Python implementation of the Bitcoin protocol parsing and networking. Protocoin doesnâ€™t implement the protocol rules, only the serialization/deserialization procedures and also basic clients to interact with the Bitcoin P2P network.

Protocoin is intended to be used to build clients that will collect statistics of the network, but you can also use it to implement a full Bitcoin client."
