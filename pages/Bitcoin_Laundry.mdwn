Accepts your payment, deducts a small commission (0.5%) and then forwards the balance on to a Bitcoin [[address]] that you designate.

A laundry service mixes ones funds with others with the intention to confuse the trail back to the original source of the funds.  Compared to traditional financial systems this service might be the equivalent of moving funds through banks located in countries that have strict bank-secrecy laws. Such countries include the Cayman Islands, the Bahamas, and Panama (1.1).

The service was announced on December 03, 2010 (1.2).

##Criticism

This service has been reported to be only lightly used and as a result you may get your own coins back.
