These changes are considered to be against the spirit of Bitcoin. Even if *all* Bitcoin users decide to adopt any of these changes, the resulting cryptocurrency can no longer be considered "Bitcoin" because it has diverged too much from the original design.

* Increasing the total number of bitcoins beyond 21 million.
* Changing the bitcoin distribution algorithm whatsoever before block 6930000.
* Recyling lost coins. People use Bitcoin assuming that some bitcoins will inevitably be lost. If coins are artificially "un-lost", the money supply is changed in a way that people would not have expected.
* Any rule that adds required, explicit centralization. For example, a change requiring that all blocks be signed by some central organization.
