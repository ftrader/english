These changes are considered to be against the spirit of Bitcoin. Even if *all* Bitcoin users decide to adopt any of these changes, the resulting cryptocurrency can no longer be considered "Bitcoin" because it has diverged too much from the original design.

* Increasing the total number of issued bitcoins beyond 21 million, or decreasing it below 20999999.9769 (the currently-planned limit). It would make sense to increase the limit from the current value if precision is increased, but not beyond 21 million. 
* Changing the bitcoin distribution algorithm whatsoever before block 6930000. [The reward is currently planned to drop to zero after this block](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=130614.0), but some adjustment may be necessary after this point if precision is increased.
* Recycling lost coins. People use Bitcoin assuming that some bitcoins will inevitably be lost. If coins are artificially "un-lost", the money supply is changed in a way that people would not have expected.
* Any rule that adds required, explicit centralization. For example, a change requiring that all blocks be signed by some central organization.
