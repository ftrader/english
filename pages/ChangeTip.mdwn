###Terms and Conditions

To use ChangeTip, including to receive a tip someone else has sent to you, you are required to agree to a long list of terms and conditions (5.1).
Among these conditions, you must agree to surrender your constitutional (at least in the USA) right to a trial by jury.
Additionally, you must give up your right to reverse engineer their service.
Many people find these terms unreasonable, and are as a result denied the tips that others may wish to send them via ChangeTip.
