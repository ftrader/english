[[!template id=infobox_company image=[[Image:ChangeTip.png‎‎ 256px]] name=ChangeTip foundation="December 17, 2013" industry=[[Tipping]] website=https://www.changetip.com]]ChangeTip integrates payment processing with social media and the web at large to transform the idea of a "share" into a method of financial appreciation, redefining the way people think about purchasing goods and services. Instead of broadcasting a tip as a bitcoin transaction, a separate ledger is kept by ChangeTip, only pushing on-chain transactions when a user withdraws funds from the service. Tipping has been made possible on GitHub, Google+, Reddit, StockTwits, Tumblr, Twitter and YouTube.

##History
