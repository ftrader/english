A special type of Bitcoin wallet that works as a bearer instrument that can be used to store bitcoins more safely or for trade offline.

A physical bitcoin holds the coin's public address and a hidden private address.  The intention with a physical bitcoin is that the value of the coin has not and cannot be spent as long as the private address remains hidden, which is likely achieved through the use of a tamper-evident seal.

The earliest physical bitcoin, the [[Bitbill|Bitbills]], was shaped liked a credit card but that was then followed by the [[Casascius_physical_bitcoin]] which was affixed to a round medal.
