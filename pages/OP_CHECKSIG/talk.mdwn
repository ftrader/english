#Redundant step?

Under "How it works", we have steps 2 and 6:

- 2. A new subscript is created from the instruction from the most recent OP_CODESEPARATOR to the end of the script. If there is no OP_CODESEPARATOR the entire script becomes the subscript (hereby referred to as subScript)

- 6. All OP_CODESEPARATORS are removed from subScript

However, doesn't step 6 seem redundant? [Vegard](User:Vegard)


Answer: ([sirk390](User:sirk390))
The comment for step 6. in the bitcoin sources help to understand this (script.cpp:882)
	// In case concatenating two scripts ends up with two codeseparators,
	// or an extra one at the end, this prevents all those possible incompatibilities. 
In step 2, only OP_CODESEPARATOR before OP_CHECKSIG are removed. In step OP_CODESEPARATOR after OP_CHECKSIG are also removed.

# Code samples and raw dumps 

I think there is some error in the section "Code samples and raw dumps" - The input script is:

"04 11 db 93 e1 dc db 8a 
01 6b 49 84 0f 8c 53 bc

and should probably be "304402204e45e16932b8af514961a1d3a1a25fdf3f4f7732e9d624c6c61548ab5fb8cd410220181522ec8eca07de4860a4acdd12909d831cc56cbbac4622082221a8768d1d0901", at least according to the Block Explorer:
