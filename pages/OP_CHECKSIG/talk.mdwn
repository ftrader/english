#Redundant step?

Under "How it works", we have steps 2 and 6:

- 2. A new subscript is created from the instruction from the most recent OP_CODESEPARATOR to the end of the script. If there is no OP_CODESEPARATOR the entire script becomes the subscript (hereby referred to as subScript)

- 6. All OP_CODESEPARATORS are removed from subScript

However, doesn't step 6 seem redundant? [Vegard](User:Vegard)
