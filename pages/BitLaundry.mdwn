BitLaundry is a Bitcoin [[mixing_service]] or tumbler, designed to help unlink Bitcoin transactions and addresses from each other. The service allows users to enter up to 10 destination Bitcoin addresses and to have their payouts scheduled over up to 10 days with up to 10 transactions per day. As of February 18, 2016, it charges a base fee of 0.49% of the total amount input to a tumbling scheme, plus BTC 0.00049 per outgoing transaction. BitLaundry advertises itself as "For all your Bitcoin washing needs."

The mixer was introduced on September 1, 2010 (1.1), and on May 19, 2011 a new operator, stateless ex-American [Mike Gogulski](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Gogulski), announced that he acquired BitLaundry. (1.2)
