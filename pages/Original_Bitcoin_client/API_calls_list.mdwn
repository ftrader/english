Bitcoin API call list (as of version 0.8.0)

## Common operations

### Listing my bitcoin addresses

Listing the bitcoin [[addresses|address]] in your wallet is easily done via *listreceivedbyaddress*. It normally lists only addresses which already have received transactions, however you can list all the addresses by setting the first argument to 0, and the second one to true.

[[Accounts|accounts_explained]] are used to organize addresses.

## Full list

Required arguments are denoted inside &lt; and &gt; Optional arguments are inside  [[and]].
