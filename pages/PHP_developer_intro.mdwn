For the sake of this tutorial we assume an Ubuntu server running with PHP. The use case here is integrating a shopping system to accept Bitcoins. We assume some knowledge of Bitcoin and experience in PHP.

You can substitute any other language here for PHP. See the associated [[API reference|API_reference_(JSON-RPC)]] pages for info on other languages.

## Setting up Bitcoin

You will run Bitcoin in daemon mode. The way PHP communicates is through localhost HTTP requests. You use a library called [JSON-RPC](http://jsonrpcphp.org/) to call the various functions. It will respond back with a [JSON object](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Json).

Bitcoins are stored internally as 64 bit integers. Because PHP's JSON implementation does not provide a way to use custom types for decimal numbers, we must use an alternative branch of Bitcoin which returns all decimal amounts as strings.

<source lang="bash">

1. install needed packages
$ sudo apt-get install build-essential libboost-all-dev libdb4.7++-dev libssl-dev libglib2.0-dev
$ git clone git://github.com/genjix/bitcoin.git
$ cd bitcoin/
$ make -f makefile.unix bitcoind
$ ./bitcoind

1. wait a few seconds for it to start up
$ ./bitcoind getinfo
</source>

Bitcoin is now initialising and you must wait until "blocks" is at the [current count](http://bitcoinwatch.com/).
