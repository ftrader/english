The [libbitcoin-network](https://github.com/libbitcoin/libbitcoin-network) library is a partial implementation of the [[Bitcoin P2P network protocol|Protocol_documentation]]. Excluded are all sub-protocols that require access to a blockchain. The [[libbitcoin-node|Libbitcoin_Node]] library extends this P2P networking capability and incorporates [[libbitcoin-blockchain|Libbitcoin_Blockchain]] in order to implement a [[full node|Full_node]]. The [[libbitcoin-explorer|Libbitcoin_Explorer]] library uses the P2P networking capability to post transactions to the P2P network.

##Example
	#include <future>
	#include <bitcoin/network.hpp>
	
	// Send a transaction to a single P2P node.
	int main(int argc, char* argv[])
	{
	using namespace bc;

	data_chunk decoded;
	if (argc < 1  !decode_base16(decoded, argv[[0]]))
	return -1;

	const auto tx = chain::transaction::factory_from_data(decoded);

	auto settings = network::settings::mainnet;
	settings.inbound_port = 0;
	settings.host_pool_capacity = 0;
	settings.outbound_connections = 0;
	settings.relay_transactions = false;

	network::p2p network(settings);
	std::promise<code> complete;

     const auto send_handler = [&complete](const code& ec)
     {
         complete.set_value(ec);
     };

     const auto connect_handler = [&tx , &send_handler](const code& ec,
         network::channel::ptr node)
     {
         if (!ec)
             node->send(tx, send_handler);
     };

     return complete.get_future().get() ? -1 : 0;
 }

==History==
* The P2P protocol was originally contained within the [[Libbitcoin_Common|libbitcoin]] library.

* In the winter of 2014 William Swanson reorganized libbitcoin sources<ref>[https://lists.dyne.org/lurker/message/20141201.054416.c146b7bc.en.html Libbitcoin network refactoring]</ref> in accordance with the roadmap<ref>[https://lists.dyne.org/lurker/message/20140924.201619.e3930350.en.html Libbitcoin roadmap summary]</ref> agreed in Toronto earlier that year.

* Later sources were moved into the libbitcoin::network namespace, and by early 2016 the namespace was forked into its own repository and integrated with dependent repositories as of version 3.
