The [libbitcoin-network](https://github.com/libbitcoin/libbitcoin-network) library is a partial implementation of the [[Bitcoin P2P network protocol|Protocol_documentation]]. Excluded are all sub-protocols that require access to a blockchain. The [[libbitcoin-node|Libbitcoin_Node]] library extends this P2P networking capability and incorporates [[libbitcoin-blockchain|Libbitcoin_Blockchain]] in order to implement a [[full node|Full_node]]. The [[libbitcoin-explorer|Libbitcoin_Explorer]] library uses the P2P networking capability to post transactions to the P2P network.

##Example
	TODO
	
##History

* The P2P protocol was originally contained within the [[libbitcoin|Libbitcoin_Common]] library.

* In the winter of 2014 William Swanson reorganized libbitcoin sources (3.1) in accordance with the roadmap (3.2) agreed in Toronto earlier that year.

* Later sources were moved into the libbitcoin::network namespace, and by early 2016 the namespace was forked into its own repository and integrated with dependent repositories as of version 3.

##Dependencies

* [boost](http://www.boost.org)
* [[libbitcoin|Libbitcoin_Common]]

##See Also
