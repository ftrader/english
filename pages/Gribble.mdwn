[gribble](http://gribble.sourceforge.net/) is a modified Supybot IRC bot, carrying some useful bitcoin-related commands and factoids. The bot's command sequence is ';;', to issue any command just start a line with two semicolons. You can also issue inline commands with two commas.

It is present on #bitcoin-dev (bitcoin information queries), #bitcoin-market (real time streaming quotes from bitcoinmarket.com and mtgox.com), #bitcoin-otc (facilitate over-the-counter trading, with the OTC order book and OTC web of trust). You can also PM commands to gribble and it will PM back.

##General Info

To get help on any command, try 'help <command>', to get a list of bitcoin-related commands, run 'apropos bc', and to get a list of factoids, run command 'facts', and click on the link supplied.

##List of commands

###Bitcoin-related commands

* **bc,bcm** - show the market snapshot from bitcoinmarket.com
* **bc,blocks** - show the current number of blocks in the bitcoin block chain
* **bc,btcex** - show the market snapshot from btcex.com
* **bc,calc** - given a hash rate in Khps, calculate the expected average time to generate a block, at current difficulty. For example, to see the average time for 1000 Khps, run 'bc,calc 1000'.
* **bc,calcd** - given a hash rate in Khps, and a difficulty level, calculate the expected average time to generate a block at that difficulty. For example, to see the average time for 1000 Khps at difficulty 1, run 'bc,calc 1000 1'.
* **bc,channels** - gives you a list of the major bitcoin-related irc channels.
* **bc,diff** - show the current generation difficulty
* **bc,estimate** - show the estimate of the next difficulty (4.1)
* **bc,gen** - given the hash rate in Khps, calculate expected BTC generation per day and per hour, at current difficulty.
* **bc,gend** - given the hash rate in Khps, and a difficulty level, calculate expected BTC generation per day and per hour at that difficulty.
* **bc,help** - show the list of all 'bc,*' commands. same as 'apropos bc'.
* **bc,hextarget** - show the current difficulty target in hex.
* **bc,mtgox** - show the market snapshot for mtgox.com
* **bc,markets** - show market snapshot for various markets. (thanks tcatm and http://bitcoincharts.com for the data feed)
* **bc,nexttarget** - show the block at which the next difficulty change will take place
* **bc,poolstats** - show the statistics about the [slush mining pool](http://mining.bitcoin.cz).
* **bc,prob** - show the probability of getting at least one block at given Khps, in a given time period. E.g., to see probability of getting a block at 1000 Khps, in 2 years and 1 week, try 'bc,prob 1000 2y 1w'. Time takes input in years, weeks, days, hours, minutes, and seconds.
* **bc,stats** - show some statistics about the block chain - number of blocks, difficulty, estimated next difficulty target, time to next difficulty
* **bc,timetonext** - show estimated time to reach the next difficulty target
* **bc,totalbc** - show total number of bitcoins in existence.
* **bc,wiki** - fetch a link to a page in this wiki, based on a search string. For example, to see a link to this page, try 'bc,wiki gribble'. 

Big kudos goes out to theymos for providing a web interface to [real time statistics about the bitcoin block chain](http://blockexplorer.com/q/).

###General commands

The above list is specifically for bitcoin-related commands. See [this page](http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/gribble/index.php?title=Using_Gribble_on_Sourceforge) for list and help of most commonly used non-bitcoin-related gribble commands. You can find more helpful info on the [gribble](http://gribble.sourceforge.net/) project page, or by exploring the bot with 'list' and 'help' commands.
