[gribble](http://gribble.sourceforge.net/) is a modified Supybot IRC bot, carrying some useful bitcoin-related commands and factoids. The bot's command sequence is ';;', to issue any command just start a line with two semicolons. You can also issue inline commands with two commas. 

It is present on #bitcoin (general discussion), #bitcoin-dev (bitcoin information queries), #bitcoin-market (real time streaming quotes from bitcoinmarket.com and mtgox.com), #bitcoin-otc (facilitate over-the-counter trading, with the OTC order book and OTC web of trust). You can also PM commands to gribble and it will PM back.

##General Info

To get help on any command, try 'help <command>', to get a list of bitcoin-related commands, run 'apropos bc', and to get a list of factoids, run command 'facts', and click on the link supplied.

##List of commands

###Mining/network/hashrate stats

* **bc,hextarget** - show the current difficulty target in hex.
* **bcstats** - show some statistics about the block chain - number of blocks, difficulty, estimated next difficulty target, time to next difficulty
* **blocks** - show the current number of blocks in the bitcoin block chain
* **blockdiff** - show difficulty for a specified past block.
* **bounty** - show current block reward bounty, in BTC.
* **diff** - show the current generation difficulty
* **diffchange** - show estimated percent change in difficulty
* **estimate** - show the estimate of the next difficulty, based on data since last change (4.1), and for last three days.
* **genprob** - show the probability of getting at least one block at given hashrate, in a given time period, at given difficulty. user current difficulty by default.
* **genrate** - given the hash rate, and optional difficulty, calculate expected BTC generation per day and per hour. uses current difficulty by default.
* **gentime** - given a hash rate, and optional difficulty level, calculate the expected average time to generate a block. uses current difficulty by default.
* **halfreward** - show estimated time of next block reward halving.
* **interval** - show the average time between blocks, over the past 1000 blocks. If given optional integer argument, use that many blocks for the estimate.
* **nethash** - current 3-day estimate of network hash power, in Ghps.
* **nextretarget** - show the block at which the next difficulty change will take place
* **prevdiff** - show previous difficulty level
* **prevdiffchange** - show previous difficulty percent change.
* **timetonext** - show estimated time to reach the next difficulty target
* **totalbc** - show total number of bitcoins in existence.
* **tslb** - show time elapsed since last generated block.

Big kudos goes out to theymos for providing a web interface to [real time statistics about the bitcoin block chain](http://blockexplorer.com/q/), and to http://blockchain.info for a similar service.
