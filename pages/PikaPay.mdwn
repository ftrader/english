The service was formally launched during the Bitcoin Foundation on May 19, 2013.  It was created by the developer of the first Bitcoin-to-Twitter payment service, PayBitBack, which sent its first bitcoins on  June 2011.  PikaPay.com began operating in December 2012.  It announced a [vulnerability bounty program](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=154465.0), at that time the community's first, on March 18, 2013.
