Personally, I don't like the nomenclature "version".  It's signalling far more than just a version.  How about "address class"?

The "version" portion of the address has so far been labeled "network id", and signals from which network and which chain the address can be used for. I thin that this change from network id to version is much more fundamental and should not just be squeezed in alone with bip16/17.
The right way to do this is to structure the bitcoin address into:
base58-encode: [version](one-byte)[hash](20-byte)[one for version](1-bytes)[checksum](3-byte)

This will move the possibility of using a faulty address from 1 to 4bill to 1 to 24mio. Recall that for most other payment systems this checksum is 1 to 9! So it should be sufficient.
An old client will then render the new addresses as useless and they will still maintain their old familiar 1xxx look - the whole point in multisig is that it should not be a matter of the paying party to worry about securing wallet of the receiver, hence he should not be bothered with a new "3" kind of address now...
