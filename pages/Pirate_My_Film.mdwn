A crowdfunding platform primarily for film projects.  

Projects can be funded using bitcoins.  Projects that are meant to be dividend-paying to the shareholders pay out dividends in the form of bitcoins.

Pirate My Film is operated by Max Keiser.

The first project to accept Bitcoin as a payment method was [Screw Banks, Use Bitcoins](http://www.piratemyfilm.com/projects/304) (1.1).
