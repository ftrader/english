**Halving day 2012** (November 28, 2012) was the day of the first [[subsidy halving|controlled_supply]], which occurred when **block 210000** was solved. Until [[block 420000|halving_day_2016]], the block reward would be 25 BTC instead of the original 50 BTC.

At the moment before the halving, 10,500,000 BTC had been mined, 50% of the target cap.

##Solution
[[!img "rad5970.jpg" size=120x120 title="A Radeon HD 5800 Series graphics card, the same series of the GPU used to solve block 210000"]]Block 210000 was found and broadcast on 2012-11-28 at 15:24:38 UTC. (2.1) [[Slushs_pool]] was responsible for finding the solution, (2.2) and a miner named *laughingbear* contributed the solution. (2.3)

The block was solved by a Radeon HD 5800 (2.4) after mining for less than a week. (2.5) This GPU would later be sold to [[Chaang_Noi]] at a significant markup on August 26, 2013. (2.6) Several images of the card were posted to [[Bitmit]], but no copies are currently known to exist. (2.7)
