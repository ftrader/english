**Denarium physical bitcoins**, also called **Denarium coins**, are physical metal coins created by a Finnish Bitcoin company [Prasos](User:Prasos) (Prasos Ltd, Jyväskylä, Finland) that contain an embedded piece of paper with digital Bitcoin value, covered by a tamper-resistant hologram. Denarium coins are available in different BTC increments. They can be purchased at Denarium's website, https://www.denarium.com (multiple payment methods accepted: Bitcoin, Visa, Mastercard, IBAN/SEPA bank transfer).

The coins are designed such that they could be circulated in face-to-face transactions. The first person to redeem its [[private_key]] gets the value on the coin, and afterwards, the coin no longer has any Bitcoin value. It is difficult or impossible to read the private key on the coin without damaging or destroying the hologram, which exposes a honeycomb-like tamper-evidence pattern when peeled.


The piece of durable paper inside each coin has a private key which forms the backing for the Bitcoin value represented by the coin. Private key is in 30-character mini private key format. Redeeming the private key back into digital Bitcoins is currently available with a patched reference client as well as with many alternative clients such as Mycelium.

Denarium coins are similar to [[Bitbills]] and [[Casascius physical bitcoins|Casascius_physical_bitcoins]] in that they are an object that contains a redemption code that serves as a bearer item for digital bitcoins.
