An open-source, python-based, wallet-management application for the Bitcoin network.

At the alpha-level stage, Armory is a proof-of-concept release.  It is very resource-intensive and thus will not be usable by everyone.  The beta version of the project is being crowdfunded (1.1). 

Available for Windows and Linux. Armory can be built for OS X but does not (yet) have OS X binaries.

Armory is licensed under the AGPL.

##Features
