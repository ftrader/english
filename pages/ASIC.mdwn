An Application-specific integrated circuit, is an [integrated circuit](wikipedia:integrated circuit) (IC) customized for a particular use, rather than intended for general-purpose use. For example, a chip designed to run in a digital voice recorder or a high-efficiency Bitcoin miner is an ASIC.

To learn more about ASICs in general, see the Wikipedia article: [en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application-specific_integrated_circuit](//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application-specific_integrated_circuit)

In [[Bitcoin mining hardware|Mining_hardware_comparison]], ASICs were the next step for development after [[CPUs, GPUs|Why_a_GPU_mines_faster_than_a_CPU]] and [[FPGAs|FPGA]].  Capable of easily outperforming the aforementioned platforms for Bitcoin [[mining]] in both speed and efficiency, all Bitcoin mining hardware that is practical in use will make use of one or more Bitcoin ([[SHA256d|Block_hashing_algorithm]]) ASICs.

Note that Bitcoin ASIC chips generally can *only be used for Bitcoin mining*.  While there are rare exceptions - for example chips that mine both Bitcoin and Litecoin - this is often because the chip package effectively has two ASICs: one for Bitcoin and one for Litecoin.

The ASIC chip of choice determines, in large part, the cost and efficiency of a given miner, as ASIC development and manufacture are very expensive processes, and the ASIC chips themselves are often the components that require the most power on a Bitcoin miner.

While there are many Bitcoin mining hardware manufacturers, some of these should be seen as [Systems integrators](wikipedia:Systems integrator) - using the ASIC chips manufactured by other parties, and combining them with other electronic components on a board to form the Bitcoin mining hardware.
