Type names used in this documentation are from the C99 standard.

## Common standards

### Hashes

Usually, when a hash is computed within bitcoin, it is computed twice. Most of the time [SHA-256](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2) hashes are used, however [RIPEMD-160](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RIPEMD) is also used when a shorter hash is desireable (for example when creating a bitcoin address).

Example of double-SHA-256 encoding of string "hello":

	hello
	2cf24dba5fb0a30e26e83b2ac5b9e29e1b161e5c1fa7425e73043362938b9824 (first round of sha-256)
	9595c9df90075148eb06860365df33584b75bff782a510c6cd4883a419833d50 (second round of sha-256)

For bitcoin addresses (RIPEMD-160) this would give:

	hello
	2cf24dba5fb0a30e26e83b2ac5b9e29e1b161e5c1fa7425e73043362938b9824 (first round is sha-256)
	b6a9c8c230722b7c748331a8b450f05566dc7d0f (with ripemd-160)

### Signatures

Bitcoin uses [Elliptic Curve](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_curve_cryptography) [Digital Signature Algorithm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Signature_Algorithm) (ECDSA) to sign transactions. 

For ECDSA the secp256k1 curve from http://www.secg.org/collateral/sec2_final.pdf is used.
Public keys (in scripts) are given as 04 <x> <y> where x and y are 32 byte strings representing the coordinates of a point on the curve.

### Transaction Verification

The first transaction of a block is usually the generating transaction, which do not include any "in" transaction, and generate bitcoins (from fees for example) usually received by whoever solved the block containing this transaction.
Such transactions are called a "coinbase transaction" and are accepted by bitcoin clients without any need to execute scripts, provided there is only one per block.

If a transaction is not a coinbase, it references previous transaction hashes as input, and the index of the other transaction's output used as input for this transaction.
The script from the in part of this transaction is executed.
Then the script from the out part of the referenced transaction is executed.
It is considered valid if the top element of the stack is true.

### Addresses

A bitcoin address is in fact the hash of a ECDSA public key, computed this way:

	Version = 1 byte of 0 (zero); on the test network, this is 1 byte of 111
	Key hash = Version concatenated with RIPEMD-160(SHA-256(public key))
	Checksum = 1st 4 bytes of SHA-256(SHA-256(Key hash))
	Bitcoin Address = Base58Encode(Key hash concatenated with Checksum)

The Base58 encoding used is home made, and has some differences. Especially, leading zeroes are kept as single zeroes when conversion happens.

## Common structures

Almost all integers are encoded in little endian. Only IP or port number are encoded big endian.

### Message structure



|4 |magic |uint32_t |Magic value indicating message origin network, and used to seek to next message when stream state is unknown
|12 |command |char[[12]]|ASCII string identifying the packet content, NULL padded (non-NULL padding results in packet rejected)
|4 |length |uint32_t |Length of payload
|4 |checksum |uint32_t |First 4 bytes of sha256(sha256(payload))
|? |payload |char[]|The actual data (can be empty, in which case checksum is excluded, and length is set to 0


Known magic values:



|main |F9BEB4D9
|testnet |FABFB5DA


### Variable length integer

Integer can be encoded depending on the represented value to save space.  Variable length integers always precede an array/vector of a type of data that may vary in length.



|< 0xfd |1 |uint8_t
|<= 0xffff |3 |0xfd + uint16_t
|<= 0xffffffff |5 |0xfe + uint32_t
|- |9 |0xff + uint64_t


### Variable length string

Variable length string can be stored using a variable length integer followed by the string itself.



|? |length |var_int |Length of the string
|? |string |char[]|The string itself (can be empty)


### Network address

When a network address is needed somewhere, this structure is used.  This protocol and structure supports IPv6, **but note that the official client currently only supports IPv4 networking**.



|8 |services |uint64_t |same service(s) listed in [[version|#version]]?
|16 |IPv6/4 |char[[16]]|IPv6 address. Network byte order. The official client only supports IPv4 and only reads the last 4 bytes to get the IPv4 address. However, the official client writes the IPv4 address into the message as a 16 byte [IPv4-mapped IPv6 address](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv6#IPv4-mapped_IPv6_addresses)(12 bytes *00 00 00 00  00 00 00 00  00 00 FF FF*, followed by the 4 bytes of the IPv4 address).
|2 |port |uint16_t |port number, network byte order

|Port |20 8D |8333 |Network byte order


### Inventory Vectors

Inventory vectors are used for notifying other nodes about objects they have or data which is being requested.

Inventory vectors consist of the following data format:



|4 |type |uint32_t |Identifies the object type linked to this inventory
|32 |hash |char[[32]]|Hash of the object



The object type is currently defined as one of the following possibilities:



|0 |ERROR |Any data of with this number may be ignored
|1 |MSG_TX |Hash is related to a transaction
|2 |MSG_BLOCK |Hash is related to a data block


Other Data Type values are considered reserved for future implementations.

## Message types

### version

When a node receives an incoming connection, it will immediatly advertise its version. No futher communication is possible until both peers have exchanged their version.

Payload:



|4 |version |uint32_t |Identifies protocol version being used by the node
|8 |services |uint64_t |bitfield of features to be enabled for this connection
|8 |timestamp |uint64_t |standard UNIX timestamp in seconds
|26 |addr_me |net_addr |The network address of the node emitting this message
|colspan="4"version >= 106
|26 |addr_you |net_addr |The network address seen by the node emitting this message (ie, the address of the receiving node)
|8 |nonce |uint64_t |Node random unique id. This id is used to detect connections to self
|? |sub_version_num |var_str |Secondary Version information (null terminated?)
|colspan="4"version >= 209
|4 |start_height |uint32_t |The last block received by the emitting node


If the emitter of the packet has version >= 209, a "verack" packet shall be sent if the version packet was accepted.

The following services are currently assigned:



|1 |NODE_NETWORK |This node can be asked for full blocks instead of just headers.

### verack

The *verack* message is sent in reply to *version* for clients >= 209.  This message consists of only a [[message header|#Message_structure]] with the command string "verack".

Hexdump of the verack message:

<pre>
0000   F9 BE B4 D9 76 65 72 61  63 6B 00 00 00 00 00 00   ....verack......

|Length |00 00 00 00 |0 |Payload is 0 bytes long


### addr

Provide informations on known nodes of the network. Non-advertised nodes should be forgotten after typically 3 hours

Payload (maximum payload length: 1000 bytes):



|? |count |var_int |Number of address entries
|26x? |addr_list |net_addr[]|Address of other nodes on the network. version < 209 will only read the first one


**Note**: Starting version 31402, addresses are prefixed with a timestamp. If no timestamp is present, the addresses should not be relayed to other peers, unless it is indeed confirmed they are up.

### inv

Allows a node to advertise its knowledge of one or more objects. It can be received unsolicited, or in reply to *getblocks*.

Payload (maximum payload length: 50000 bytes):



|? |count |var_int |Number of inventory entries
|36x? |inventory |inv_vect[]|Inventory vectors


### getdata

getdata is used in response to inv, to retrieve the content of a specific object, and is usually sent after receiving an *inv* packet, after filtering known elements.

Payload (maximum payload length: 50000 bytes):



|? |count |var_int |Number of inventory entries
|36x? |inventory |inv_vect[]|Inventory vectors


### getblocks

Return an *inv* packet containing the list of blocks starting at hash_start, up to hash_stop or 500 blocks, whichever comes first. To receive the next blocks hashes, one needs to issue getblocks again with the last known hash.

Payload:



|4 |version |uint32_t |only present if nType has SER_GETHASH set (purpose unknown)
|1+ |start count |var_int |number of hash_start entries
|32+ |hash_start |char[[32]]|hash of the last known block of the emitting node
|32 |hash_stop |char[[32]]|hash of the last desired block. Set to zero to get as many blocks as possible (500)


### tx

*tx* describes a bitcoin transaction, in reply to *getdata*




|4 |version |uint32_t |Transaction data format version
|1+ |tx_in count |var_int |Number of Transaction inputs
|41+ |tx_in |tx_in[]|A list of 1 or more transaction inputs or sources for coins

|8+ |tx_out |tx_out[]|A list of 1 or more transaction outputs or destinations for coins
|4 |lock_time |uint32_t |The block number or timestamp at which this transaction is locked, or 0 if the transaction is always locked. A non-locked transaction must not be included in blocks, and it can be modified by broadcasting a new version before the time has expired (replacement is currently disabled in Bitcoin, however, so this is useless).


TxIn consists of the following fields:



|36 |previous_output |outpoint |The previous output transaction reference, as an OutPoint structure
|1+ |script length |var_int |The length of the signature script
|? |signature script |char[]|Computational Script for confirming transaction authorization
|4 |sequence |uint32_t |Transaction version as defined by the sender. Intended for "replacement" of transactions when information is updated before inclusion into a block.


The OutPoint structure consists of the following fields:



|32 |hash |char[[32]]|The hash of the referenced transaction.
|4 |index |uint32_t |The index of the specific output in the transaction. The first output is 0, etc.


The Script structure consists of a series of pieces of information and operations related to the value of the transaction.

(Structure to be expanded in the future… see script.h and script.cpp for more information)

The TxOut structure consists of the following fields:



|8 |value |uint64_t |Transaction Value
|1+ |pk_script length |var_int |Length of the pk_script
|? |pk_script |char[]|Usually contains the public key as a Bitcoin script setting up conditions to claim this output.


### block

The **block** message is sent in response to a getdata message which requests transaction information from a block hash.



|4 |version |uint32_t |Block version information, based upon the software version creating this block
|32 |prev_block |char[[32]]|The hash value of the previous block this particular block references
|32 |merkle_root |char[[32]]|The reference to a Merkle tree collection which is a hash of all transactions related to this block
|4 |timestamp |uint32_t |A timestamp recording when this block was created (Limited to 2038!)
|4 |bits |uint32_t |The calculated difficulty target being used for this block
|4 |nonce |uint32_t |The nonce used to generate this block… to allow variations of the header and compute different hashes
|? |txn_count |var_int |Number of transaction entries
|? |txns |tx[]|Block transactions, in format of "tx" command


### getaddr

The getaddr message sends a request to a node asking for information about known active peers to help with identifying potential nodes in the network. The response to receiving this message is to transmit an addr message with one or more peers from a database of known active peers. The typical presumption is that a node is likely to be active if it has been sending a message within the last three hours.

No additional data is transmitted with this message.

### checkorder

This message is used for [[IP_Transactions]], to ask the peer if it accepts such transactions and allow it to look at the content of the order.

It contains a CWalletTx object

Payload:



|colspan="4"Fields from CMerkleTx
|? |hashBlock
|? |vMerkleBranch
|? |nIndex
|colspan="4"Fields from CWalletTx
|? |vtxPrev
|? |mapValue
|? |vOrderForm
|? |fTimeReceivedIsTxTime
|? |nTimeReceived
|? |fFromMe
|? |fSpent


### submitorder

Confirms an order has been submitted. 

Payload:



|32 |hash |char[[32]]|Hash of the transaction
|? |wallet_entry |CWalletTx |Same payload as checkorder


### reply

Generic reply for [[IP_Transactions]]

Payload:



|4 |reply |uint32_t |reply code


Possible values:



|0 |SUCCESS |The IP Transaction can proceed (*checkorder*), or has been accepted (*submitorder*)
|1 |WALLET_ERROR |AcceptWalletTransaction() failed
|2 |DENIED |IP Transactions are not accepted by this node


### ping

The *ping* message is sent primarily to confirm that the TCP/IP connection is still valid. An error in transmission is presumed to be a closed connection and the address is removed as a current peer. No reply is expected as a result of this message being sent nor any sort of action expected on the part of a client when it is used.

### alert

An **alert** is sent between nodes to send a general notification message throughout the network. If the alert can be confirmed with the signature as having come from the the core development group of the Bitcoin software, the message is suggested to be displayed for end-users. Attempts to perform transactions, particularly automated transactions through the client, are suggested to be halted. The text in the Message string should be relayed to log files and any user interfaces.

Payload:



|? |message |var_str |System message which is coded to convey some information to all nodes in the network
|? |signature |var_str |A signature which can be confirmed with a public key verifying that it is Satoshi (the originator of Bitcoins) who has "authorized" or created the message


The signature is to be compared to this ECDSA public key:

	04fc9702847840aaf195de8442ebecedf5b095cdbb9bc716bda9110971b28a49e0ead8564ff0db22209e0374782c093bb899692d524e9d6a6956e7c5ecbcd68284
