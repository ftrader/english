##Common standards

### Hashes

Usually, when a hash is computed within bitcoin, it is computed twice. Most of the time [SHA-256](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2) hashes are used, however [RIPEMD-160](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RIPEMD) is also used when a shorter hash is desirable (for example when creating a bitcoin address).

Example of double-SHA-256 encoding of string "hello":

	hello
	2cf24dba5fb0a30e26e83b2ac5b9e29e1b161e5c1fa7425e73043362938b9824 (first round of sha-256)
	9595c9df90075148eb06860365df33584b75bff782a510c6cd4883a419833d50 (second round of sha-256)

For bitcoin addresses (RIPEMD-160) this would give:

	hello
	2cf24dba5fb0a30e26e83b2ac5b9e29e1b161e5c1fa7425e73043362938b9824 (first round is sha-256)
	b6a9c8c230722b7c748331a8b450f05566dc7d0f (with ripemd-160)

### Merkle Trees

Merkle trees are binary trees of hashes. Merkle trees in bitcoin use **Double** SHA-256, and are built up as so:
	
	hash(a) = sha256(sha256(a))
	
	hash(a) hash(b) hash(c)
	hash(hash(a)+hash(b)) hash(hash(c)+hash(c))
	hash(hash(hash(a)+hash(b))+hash(hash(c)+hash(c)))

They are paired up, with the last element being _duplicated_.

Note: Hashes in Merkle Tree displayed in the [[Block_Explorer]] are of little-endian notation. For some implementations and [calculations](http://www.fileformat.info/tool/hash.htm), the bits need to be reversed before they are hashed, and again after the hashing operation.

### Signatures

Bitcoin uses [Elliptic Curve](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_curve_cryptography) [Digital Signature Algorithm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Signature_Algorithm) ([ECDSA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_Curve_DSA)) to sign transactions. 

For ECDSA the secp256k1 curve from http://www.secg.org/collateral/sec2_final.pdf is used.

Public keys (in scripts) are given as 04 <x> <y> where *x* and *y* are 32 byte big-endian integers representing the coordinates of a point on the curve or in compressed form given as <sign> <x> where <sign> is 0x02 if *y* is even and 0x03 if *y* is odd. Signatures use [DER encoding](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distinguished_Encoding_Rules) to pack the *r* and *s* components into a single byte stream (this is also what OpenSSL produces by default).

### Transaction Verification
Transactions are cryptographically signed records that reassign ownership of Bitcoins to new addresses.  Transactions have *inputs* - records which reference the funds from other previous transactions - and *outputs* - records which determine the new owner of the transferred Bitcoins, and which will be referenced as inputs in future transactions as those funds are respent.

Each *input* must have a cryptographic digital signature that unlocks the funds from the prior transaction.  Only the person possessing the appropriate [[private_key]] is able to create a satisfactory signature; this in effect ensures that funds can only be spent by their owners.

Each *output* determines which Bitcoin address (or other criteria, see [[Scripting]]) is the recipient of the funds.

In a transaction, the sum of all inputs must be equal to or greater than the sum of all outputs.  If the inputs exceed the outputs, the difference is considered a [[transaction_fee]], and is redeemable by whoever first includes the transaction into the block chain.

A special kind of transaction, called a [[coinbase_transaction]], has no inputs.  It is created by [[miners]], and there is one coinbase transaction per block.  Because each block comes with a reward of newly created Bitcoins (e.g. 50 BTC for the first 210,000 blocks), the first transaction of a block is, with few exceptions, the transaction that grants those coins to their recipient (the miner).  In addition to the newly created Bitcoins, the coinbase transaction is also used for assigning the recipient of any transaction fees that were paid within the other transactions being included in the same block.  The coinbase transaction can assign the entire reward to a single Bitcoin address, or split it in portions among multiple addresses, just like any other transaction.  Coinbase transactions always contain outputs totaling the sum of the block reward plus all transaction fees collected from the other transactions in the same block.

Most Bitcoin outputs encumber the newly transferred coins with a single ECDSA private key.  The actual record saved with inputs and outputs isn't necessarily a key, but a *script*.  Bitcoin uses an interpreted scripting system to determine whether an output's criteria have been satisfied, with which more complex operations are possible, such as outputs that require two ECDSA signatures, or two-of-three-signature schemes.  An output that references a single Bitcoin address is a *typical* output; an output actually contains this information in the form of a script that requires a single ECDSA signature (see [[OP_CHECKSIG]]).  The output script specifies what must be provided to unlock the funds later, and when the time comes in the future to spend the transaction in another input, that input must provide all of the thing(s) that satisfy the requirements defined by the original output script.

### Addresses

A bitcoin address is in fact the hash of a ECDSA public key, computed this way:

	Version = 1 byte of 0 (zero); on the test network, this is 1 byte of 111
	Key hash = Version concatenated with RIPEMD-160(SHA-256(public key))
	Checksum = 1st 4 bytes of SHA-256(SHA-256(Key hash))
	Bitcoin Address = Base58Encode(Key hash concatenated with Checksum)

The Base58 encoding used is home made, and has some differences. Especially, leading zeroes are kept as single zeroes when conversion happens.

## Common structures

Almost all integers are encoded in little endian. Only IP or port number are encoded big endian.

### Message structure



|4 |magic |uint32_t |Magic value indicating message origin network, and used to seek to next message when stream state is unknown
|12 |command |char[[12]]|ASCII string identifying the packet content, NULL padded (non-NULL padding results in packet rejected)
|4 |length |uint32_t |Length of payload in number of bytes
|4 |checksum |uint32_t |First 4 bytes of sha256(sha256(payload))
|? |payload |uchar[]|The actual data



Known magic values:



|main |0xD9B4BEF9 |F9 BE B4 D9
|testnet |0xDAB5BFFA |FA BF B5 DA


### Variable length integer

Integer can be encoded depending on the represented value to save space.  Variable length integers always precede an array/vector of a type of data that may vary in length.



|< 0xfd |1 |uint8_t
|<= 0xffff |3 |0xfd followed by the length as uint16_t
|<= 0xffffffff |5 |0xfe followed by the length as uint32_t
|- |9 |0xff followed by the length as uint64_t


### Variable length string

Variable length string can be stored using a variable length integer followed by the string itself.



|? |length |[[var_int|Protocol_specification#Variable_length_integer]]|Length of the string
|? |string |char[]|The string itself (can be empty)


### Network address

When a network address is needed somewhere, this structure is used.  This protocol and structure supports IPv6, **but note that the original client currently only supports IPv4 networking**. Network addresses are not prefixed with a timestamp in the version message.



|4 |time |uint32 |the Time (version >= 31402)
|8 |services |uint64_t |same service(s) listed in [[version|#version]]
|16 |IPv6/4 |char[[16]]|IPv6 address. Network byte order. The original client only supports IPv4 and only reads the last 4 bytes to get the IPv4 address. However, the IPv4 address is written into the message as a 16 byte [IPv4-mapped IPv6 address](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv6#IPv4-mapped_IPv6_addresses)(12 bytes *00 00 00 00  00 00 00 00  00 00 FF FF*, followed by the 4 bytes of the IPv4 address).
|2 |port |uint16_t |port number, network byte order

 20 8D                                           - Port 8333
</pre>

### Inventory Vectors

Inventory vectors are used for notifying other nodes about objects they have or data which is being requested.

Inventory vectors consist of the following data format:



|4 |type |uint32_t |Identifies the object type linked to this inventory
|32 |hash |char[[32]]|Hash of the object



The object type is currently defined as one of the following possibilities:



|0 |ERROR |Any data of with this number may be ignored
|1 |MSG_TX |Hash is related to a transaction
|2 |MSG_BLOCK |Hash is related to a data block


Other Data Type values are considered reserved for future implementations.

### Block Headers

Block headers are sent in a headers packet in response to a getheaders message.



|4 |version |uint32_t |Block version information, based upon the software version creating this block
|32 |prev_block |char[[32]]|The hash value of the previous block this particular block references
|32 |merkle_root |char[[32]]|The reference to a Merkle tree collection which is a hash of all transactions related to this block
|4 |timestamp |uint32_t |A timestamp recording when this block was created (Limited to 2106!)
|4 |bits |uint32_t |The calculated difficulty target being used for this block
|4 |nonce |uint32_t |The nonce used to generate this block… to allow variations of the header and compute different hashes
|1 |txn_count |uint8_t |Number of transaction entries, this value is always 0


## Message types

### version

When a node creates an outgoing connection, it will immediately advertise its version. The remote node will respond with its version. No futher communication is possible until both peers have exchanged their version.

Payload:



|4 |version |int32_t |Identifies protocol version being used by the node
|8 |services |uint64_t |bitfield of features to be enabled for this connection
|8 |timestamp |int64_t |standard UNIX timestamp in seconds
|26 |addr_recv |net_addr |The network address of the node receiving this message
|colspan="4"version >= 106
|26 |addr_from |net_addr |The network address of the node emitting this message
|8 |nonce |uint64_t |Node random nonce, randomly generated every time a version packet is sent. This nonce is used to detect connections to self.
|? |user_agent |[[var_str|#Variable_length_string]]|[[User Agent|BIP_0014]](0x00 if string is 0 bytes long)
|4 |start_height |int32_t |The last block received by the emitting node


A "verack" packet shall be sent if the version packet was accepted.

The following services are currently assigned:



|1 |NODE_NETWORK |This node can be asked for full blocks instead of just headers.

</pre>

### inv

Allows a node to advertise its knowledge of one or more objects. It can be received unsolicited, or in reply to *getblocks*.

Payload (maximum payload length: 50000 bytes):



|? |count |[[var_int|Protocol_specification#Variable_length_integer]]|Number of inventory entries
|36x? |inventory |[[inv_vect|Protocol_specification#Inventory_Vectors]][]|Inventory vectors


### getdata

getdata is used in response to inv, to retrieve the content of a specific object, and is usually sent after receiving an *inv* packet, after filtering known elements.

Payload (maximum payload length: 50000 bytes):



|? |count |[[var_int|Protocol_specification#Variable_length_integer]]|Number of inventory entries
|36x? |inventory |[[inv_vect|Protocol_specification#Inventory_Vectors]][]|Inventory vectors


### getblocks

Return an *inv* packet containing the list of blocks starting right after the last known (and correct) hash in the block locator object, up to hash_stop or 500 blocks, whichever comes first. To receive the next blocks hashes, one needs to issue getblocks again with a new block locator object.

Payload:



|4 |version |uint32_t |the protocol version
|1+ |hash count |[[var_int|Protocol_specification#Variable_length_integer]]|number of block locator hash entries
|32+ |block locator hashes |char[[32]]|block locator object; newest back to genesis block (dense to start, but then sparse)
|32 |hash_stop |char[[32]]|hash of the last desired block; set to zero to get as many blocks as possible (500)


To create the block locator hashes, keep pushing hashes until you go back to the genesis block. After pushing 10 hashes back, the step backwards doubles every loop:

<pre>
// From libbitcoin which is under AGPL
std::vector<size_t> block_locator_indices(int top_depth)
{
    // Start at max_depth
    std::vector<size_t> indices;
    // Push last 10 indices first
    size_t step = 1, start = 0;
    for (int i = top_depth; i > 0; i -= step, ++start)
    {
        if (start >= 10)
            step *= 2;
        indices.push_back(i);
    }
    indices.push_back(0);
    return indices;
}
</pre>

Note that it is allowed to send in fewer known hashes down to a minimum of just one hash. However, the purpose of the block locator object is to detect a wrong branch in the caller's main chain. If the peer detects that you are off the main chain, it will send in block hashes which are earlier than your last known block. So if you just send in your last known hash and it is off the main chain, the peer starts over at block #1.

### getheaders

Return a *headers* packet containing the headers of blocks starting right after the last known (and correct) hash in the block locator object, up to hash_stop or 2000 blocks, whichever comes first. To receive the next block headers, one needs to issue getheaders again with a new block locator object. The *getheaders* command is used by thin clients to quickly download the blockchain where the contents of the transactions would be irrelevant (because they are not ours). 

Payload:



|4 |version |uint32_t |the protocol version
|1+ |hash count |[[var_int|Protocol_specification#Variable_length_integer]]|number of block locator hash entries
|32+ |block locator hashes |char[[32]]|block locator object; newest back to genesis block (dense to start, but then sparse)
|32 |hash_stop |char[[32]]|hash of the last desired block header; set to zero to get as many blocks as possible (2000)


For the block locator object in this packet, the same rules apply as for the [[getblocks|Protocol_specification#Variable_length_integer]] packet.

### tx

*tx* describes a bitcoin transaction, in reply to *getdata*




|4 |version |uint32_t |Transaction data format version
|1+ |tx_in count |[[var_int|Protocol_specification#Variable_length_integer]]|Number of Transaction inputs
|41+ |tx_in |tx_in[]|A list of 1 or more transaction inputs or sources for coins
|1+ |tx_out count |[[var_int|Protocol_specification#Variable_length_integer]]|Number of Transaction outputs
|8+ |tx_out |tx_out[]|A list of 1 or more transaction outputs or destinations for coins
|4 |lock_time |uint32_t |The block number or timestamp at which this transaction is locked:

|0 |Always locked
|< 500000000  |Block number at which this transaction is locked
|>= 500000000 |UNIX timestamp at which this transaction is locked

A non-locked transaction must not be included in blocks, and it can be modified by broadcasting a new version before the time has expired (replacement is currently disabled in Bitcoin, however, so this is useless).

}

TxIn consists of the following fields:



|36 |previous_output |outpoint |The previous output transaction reference, as an OutPoint structure
|1+ |script length |[[var_int|Protocol_specification#Variable_length_integer]]|The length of the signature script
|? |signature script |uchar[]|Computational Script for confirming transaction authorization
|4 |[sequence](http://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/q/2025/323)|uint32_t |Transaction version as defined by the sender. Intended for "replacement" of transactions when information is updated before inclusion into a block.


The OutPoint structure consists of the following fields:



|32 |hash |char[[32]]|The hash of the referenced transaction.
|4 |index |uint32_t |The index of the specific output in the transaction. The first output is 0, etc.


The Script structure consists of a series of pieces of information and operations related to the value of the transaction.

(Structure to be expanded in the future… see script.h and script.cpp and [[Script]] for more information)

The TxOut structure consists of the following fields:



|8 |value |int64_t |Transaction Value
|1+ |pk_script length |[[var_int|Protocol_specification#Variable_length_integer]]|Length of the pk_script
|? |pk_script |uchar[]|Usually contains the public key as a Bitcoin script setting up conditions to claim this output.

### block

The **block** message is sent in response to a getdata message which requests transaction information from a block hash.



|4 |version |uint32_t |Block version information, based upon the software version creating this block
|32 |prev_block |char[[32]]|The hash value of the previous block this particular block references
|32 |merkle_root |char[[32]]|The reference to a Merkle tree collection which is a hash of all transactions related to this block
|4 |timestamp |uint32_t |A unix timestamp recording when this block was created (Currently limited to dates before the year 2106!)
|4 |bits |uint32_t |The calculated [[difficulty target|Difficulty]]being used for this block
|4 |nonce |uint32_t |The nonce used to generate this block… to allow variations of the header and compute different hashes
|? |txn_count |[[var_int|Protocol_specification#Variable_length_integer]]|Number of transaction entries
|? |txns |tx[]|Block transactions, in format of "tx" command


The SHA256 hash that identifies each block (and which must have a run of 0 bits) is calculated from the first 6 fields of this structure (version, prev_block, merkle_root, timestamp, bits, nonce, and standard SHA256 padding, making two 64-byte chunks in all) and *not* from the complete block. To calculate the hash, only two chunks need to be processed by the SHA256 algorithm. Since the *nonce* field is in the second chunk, the first chunk stays constant during mining and therefore only the second chunk needs to be processed. However, a Bitcoin hash is the hash of the hash, so two SHA256 rounds are needed for each mining iteration.
See [[Block_hashing_algorithm]] for details and an example.

### headers

The *headers* packet returns block headers in response to a *getheaders* packet. 

Payload:



|? |count |[[var_int|Protocol_specification#Variable_length_integer]]|Number of block headers
|81x? |headers |[[block_header|Protocol_specification#Block_Headers]][]|[[Block headers|Protocol_specification#Block_Headers]]


Note that the block headers in this packet include a transaction count (a var_int, so there can be more than 81 bytes per header) as opposed to the block headers which are sent to miners.

### getaddr

The getaddr message sends a request to a node asking for information about known active peers to help with identifying potential nodes in the network. The response to receiving this message is to transmit an addr message with one or more peers from a database of known active peers. The typical presumption is that a node is likely to be active if it has been sending a message within the last three hours.

No additional data is transmitted with this message.

### checkorder

This message is used for [[IP_Transactions]], to ask the peer if it accepts such transactions and allow it to look at the content of the order.

It contains a CWalletTx object

Payload:



|colspan="4"Fields from CMerkleTx
|? |hashBlock
|? |vMerkleBranch
|? |nIndex
|colspan="4"Fields from CWalletTx
|? |vtxPrev
|? |mapValue
|? |vOrderForm
|? |fTimeReceivedIsTxTime
|? |nTimeReceived
|? |fFromMe
|? |fSpent


### submitorder

Confirms an order has been submitted. 

Payload:



|32 |hash |char[[32]]|Hash of the transaction
|? |wallet_entry |CWalletTx |Same payload as checkorder


### reply

Generic reply for [[IP_Transactions]]

Payload:



|4 |reply |uint32_t |reply code


Possible values:



|0 |SUCCESS |The IP Transaction can proceed (*checkorder*), or has been accepted (*submitorder*)
|1 |WALLET_ERROR |AcceptWalletTransaction() failed
|2 |DENIED |IP Transactions are not accepted by this node


### ping

The *ping* message is sent primarily to confirm that the TCP/IP connection is still valid. An error in transmission is presumed to be a closed connection and the address is removed as a current peer. No reply is expected as a result of this message being sent nor any sort of action expected on the part of a client when it is used.

### alert

An **alert** is sent between nodes to send a general notification message throughout the network. If the alert can be confirmed with the signature as having come from the the core development group of the Bitcoin software, the message is suggested to be displayed for end-users. Attempts to perform transactions, particularly automated transactions through the client, are suggested to be halted. The text in the Message string should be relayed to log files and any user interfaces.

Alert format:



|? |payload |var_str |Serialized alert payload
|? |signature |var_str |An ECDSA signature of the message


The developers of Satoshi's client use this public key for signing alerts:
	04fc9702847840aaf195de8442ebecedf5b095cdbb9bc716bda9110971b28a49e0ead8564ff0db22209e0374782c093bb899692d524e9d6a6956e7c5ecbcd68284
	(hash) 1AGRxqDa5WjUKBwHB9XYEjmkv1ucoUUy1s

The payload is serialized into a var_str to ensure that versions using incompatible alert formats can still relay alerts among one another. The current alert payload format is:


|4 |Version |int32_t |Alert format version
|8 |RelayUntil |int64_t |The timestamp beyond which nodes should stop relaying this alert
|8 |Expiration |int64_t |The timestamp beyond which this alert is no longer in effect and should be ignored
|4 |ID |int32_t |A unique ID number for this alert
|4 |Cancel |int32_t |All alerts with an ID number less than or equal to this number should be canceled: deleted and not accepted in the future
|? |setCancel |set<int>|All alert IDs contained in this set should be canceled as above
|4 |MinVer |int32_t |This alert only applies to versions greater than or equal to this version. Other versions should still relay it.
|4 |MaxVer |int32_t |This alert only applies to versions less than or equal to this version. Other versions should still relay it.
|? |setSubVer |set<string>|If this set contains any elements, then only nodes that have their subVer contained in this set are affected by the alert. Other versions should still relay it.
|4 |Priority |int32_t |Relative priority compared to other alerts
|? |Comment |string |A comment on the alert that is not displayed
|? |StatusBar |string |The alert message that is displayed to the user
|? |Reserved |string |Reserved
