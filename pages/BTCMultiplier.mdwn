**[BTCMultiplier](http://btcmultiplier.com)** is a different kind of bitcoin gambling game.  It gives instant payouts with many multipliers to choose from, and many games offer several ways to win.

### Gameplay

Players choose 1-4 digits on the provided keypad, causing a bitcoin [[address]] to appear.  All the player has to do is send their bet to that address. A response payment is sent immediately.

### Prizes

For each game played, one unique, random digit is generated for every digit the player chooses.  So if the player picks 1 digit, the game generates 1 digit.  If the player picks 2 digits, the game generates 2 digits.  And so on.  Prizes are rewarded, depending on the game, when some or all of the player's digits match their game's generated "lucky" digits.  The generated game digits are verifiable with the blockchain (see the "[How It Works](http://btcmultiplier.com/howitworks.php)" page for more information).

### Multipliers

After picking their digits, players can change the game multipliers by selecting one of three sets of prizes (A, B, or C).  Depending on the game chosen, prizes with different multipliers are rewarded for matching 1 digit, 2 digits, 3 digits, 4 digits, or even 0 digits.
