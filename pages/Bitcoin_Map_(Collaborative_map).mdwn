[[!template id=outdated]]**The Bitcoin Map** was a collaborative map project intended as a visual directory to Bitcoin exchangers.  For the similarly-named project that rendered the locations of Bitcoin nodes see [[Bitcoin_Map]].

Tht service was succeeded by CoinMap and the BitcoinMap.com domain now redirects to [[http://CoinMap.org]].  The old map can still be [edited](http://www.umapper.com/maps/edit/id/84618) or downloaded [KML](http://umapper.s3.amazonaws.com/maps/kml/84618.kml).
