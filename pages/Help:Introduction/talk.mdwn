I would like to create this page, describing bitcoin in an easy manner.

"These bitcoins are valuable because they require the spending of real resources (CPU time and electricity) to produce,"

this seems to me the cost-theory of value, which is a fallacy. Digging holes in the ground requires spending of resources too.

Good page, but I was expecting a more concise introduction. Perhaps give it a more punchy, concise start?

## it.bitcoin.it

I've started filling-in a few sections of the Italian version it.bitcoin.it. If you don't mind, I am using this page as the basis. So, I'm translating it and tightening it up at the same time. Would it be OK? I've also added a summary, using the bitcoin entry in wikipedia.

ciao

##Banking and Money, in general

I am not sure about all the users of this site who are interested in and trying to understand BitCoin (as I am), but personally, I found myself, even quite recently, without an understanding about how banking and money works at all. The Khan Academy video series on banking and money was very helpful, I thought perhaps you might want to include a link in the Introduction and Basic Concepts. http://www.khanacademy.org/#banking-and-money
I think the more regular people can understand these basic things, the more they will be interested and engaged.

Thanks and great work so far it seems

## Confusion : how the Money is valued

The introduction is not upfront enough as to how Bitcoins get their value and why people are prepared to except them as money.ie We need on overview of the introduction to explain this without the explainations as to how they are created and cannot be duplicated. I gather what happens is that as long as there are enough people with things to sell and willing buyers then the money then gets its value due to its expanding usage.That is someone who has sold something can then turn around and buy something else with a bitcoin. Is that right?
And since the coins themselves are made scare by the design of their creation(time and energy) and their intrinsic unforgability (due to the mathematics) they then can be traded with confidence.Yes?
