I would like to create this page, describing bitcoin in an easy manner.

"These bitcoins are valuable because they require the spending of real resources (CPU time and electricity) to produce,"

this seems to me the cost-theory of value, which is a fallacy. Digging holes in the ground requires spending of resources too.

Good page, but I was expecting a more concise introduction. Perhaps give it a more punchy, concise start?

## it.bitcoin.it

I've started filling-in a few sections of the Italian version it.bitcoin.it. If you don't mind, I am using this page as the basis. So, I'm translating it and tightening it up at the same time. Would it be OK? I've also added a summary, using the bitcoin entry in wikipedia.

ciao
