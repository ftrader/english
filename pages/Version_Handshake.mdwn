On connect, [[version|Protocol_specification#version]] and [[verack|Protocol_specification#verack]] messages are exchanged, in order to ensure compatibility between peers.

##Version Handshake

When the local peer (L) connects to a remote peer (R), the remote peer will not send any data until it receives a version message.

	L -> R: Send version message with the local peer's version
	R -> L: Send version message back
	R:      Sets version to the minimum of the 2 versions
	R -> L: Send verack message
	L:      Sets version to the minimum of the 2 versions

Note: A version number of 10300 is converted to 300 before being processed and versions below 209 are no longer supported.
