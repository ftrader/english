##0.3.21<ref>[http://forum.bitcoin.org/?topic=6642.0 0.3.21 release announcement]</ref>=
Binaries for Bitcoin version 0.3.21 are available at:
	https://sourceforge.net/projects/bitcoin/files/Bitcoin/bitcoin-0.3.21/

Changes and new features from the 0.3.20 release include:

* Universal Plug and Play support.  Enable automatic opening of a port for incoming connections by running bitcoin or bitcoind with the - -upnp=1 command line switch or using the Options dialog box.

* Support for full-precision bitcoin amounts.  You can now send, and bitcoin will display, bitcoin amounts smaller than 0.01.  However, sending fewer than 0.01 bitcoins still requires a 0.01 bitcoin fee (so you can send 1.0001 bitcoins without a fee, but you will be asked to pay a fee if you try to send 0.0001).

* A new method of finding bitcoin nodes to connect with, via DNS A records. Use the -dnsseed option to enable.

For developers, changes to bitcoin's remote-procedure-call API:

* New rpc command "sendmany" to send bitcoins to more than one address in a single transaction.

* Several bug fixes, including a serious intermittent bug that would sometimes cause bitcoind to stop accepting rpc requests. 

* -logtimestamps option, to add a timestamp to each line in debug.log.

* Immature blocks (newly generated, under 120 confirmations) are now shown in listtransactions.

##0.3.20.2<ref>[http://forum.bitcoin.org?topic=4167.0 0.3.20.2 release announcement]</ref>=
The maxsendbuffer bug (0.3.20.1 clients not being able to download the block chain from other 0.3.20.1 clients) was only going to get
worse as people upgraded, so I cherry-picked the bug fix and created a minor release yesterday.

The Amazon Machine Images I used to do the builds are available:

	ami-38a05251   Bitcoin-v0.3.20.2 Mingw    (Windows; Administrator password 'bitcoin development')
	ami-30a05259   Bitcoin_0.3.20.2 Linux32
	ami-8abc4ee3   Bitcoin_0.3.20.2 Linux64

(mac build will be done soon)

If you have already downloaded version 0.3.20.1, please either add this to your bitcoin.conf file:

	maxsendbuffer=10000
	maxreceivebuffer=10000

... or download the new version.

##0.3.20.1
(No known forum post.)

##0.3.20<ref>[http://forum.bitcoin.org?topic=2953.0 0.3.20 release announcement]</ref>=

Bug fixes that also need testing:

##0.3.19<ref>[http://forum.bitcoin.org?topic=2228.0 0.3.19 release announcement]</ref>=
There's more work to do on DoS, but I'm doing a quick build of what I have so far in case it's needed, before venturing into more complex ideas.  The build for this is version 0.3.19.

- Added some DoS controls
As Gavin and I have said clearly before, the software is not at all resistant to DoS attack.  This is one improvement, but there are still more ways to attack than I can count.  

I'm leaving the -limitfreerelay part as a switch for now and it's there if you need it.

- Removed "safe mode" alerts
"safe mode" alerts was a temporary measure after the 0.3.9 overflow bug.  We can say all we want that users can just run with "-disablesafemode", but it's better just not to have it for the sake of appearances.  It was never intended as a long term feature.  Safe mode can still be triggered by seeing a longer (greater total PoW) invalid block chain.


##0.3.18<ref>[http://forum.bitcoin.org?topic=2162.0 0.3.18 release announcement]</ref>=

Changes:

* Fixed a wallet.dat compatibility problem if you downgraded from 0.3.17 and then upgraded again
* IsStandard() check to only include known transaction types in blocks
* Jgarzik's optimisation to speed up the initial block download a little

The main addition in this release is the Accounts-Based JSON-RPC commands that Gavin's been working on (more details at http://www.bitcoin.org/smf/index.php?topic=1886.0).  

* getaccountaddress
* sendfrom
* move
* getbalance
* listtransactions

##0.3.17<ref>[http://forum.bitcoin.org?topic=1946.0 0.3.17 release announcement]</ref>=

Version 0.3.17 is now available.

Changes:

* new getwork, thanks m0mchil
* added transaction fee setting in UI options menu
* free transaction limits
* sendtoaddress returns transaction id instead of "sent"
* getaccountaddress <account>

The UI transaction fee setting was easy since it was still there from 0.1.5 and all I had to do was re-enable it.

The accounts-based commands: move, sendfrom and getbalance <account> will be in the next release.  We still have some more changes to make first.

##0.3.16

Never released.

##0.3.15<ref>[http://forum.bitcoin.org?topic=1780.0 0.3.15 release announcement]</ref>=

* paytxfee switch is now per KB, so it adds the correct fee for large transactions
* sending avoids using coins with less than 6 confirmations if it can
* BitcoinMiner processes transactions in priority order based on age of dependencies
* make sure generation doesn't start before block 74000 downloaded
* bugfixes by Dean Gores
* testnet, keypoololdest and paytxfee added to getinfo

##0.3.14<ref>[http://forum.bitcoin.org?topic=1528.0 0.3.14 release announcement]</ref>=

Version 0.3.14 is now available
http://sourceforge.net/projects/bitcoin/files/Bitcoin/bitcoin-0.3.14/

Changes:

* Key pool feature for safer wallet backup
Gavin Andresen:

* TEST network mode with switch -testnet
* Option to use SSL for JSON-RPC connections on unix/osx
* validateaddress RPC command
eurekafag:

* Russian translation

##0.3.13<ref>[http://forum.bitcoin.org?topic=1327.0 0.3.13 release announcement]</ref>=

Version 0.3.13 is now available.  You should upgrade to prevent potential problems with 0/unconfirmed transactions.  Note: 0.3.13 prevents problems if you haven't already spent a 0/unconfirmed transaction, but if that already happened, you need 0.3.13.2.

Changes:

* Don't count or spend payments until they have 1 confirmation.
* Internal version number from 312 to 31300.
* Only accept transactions sent by IP address if -allowreceivebyip is specified.
* Dropped DB_PRIVATE Berkeley DB flag.
* Fix problem sending the last cent with sub-cent fractional change.
* Auto-detect whether to use 128-bit 4-way SSE2 on Linux.
Gavin Andresen:

* Option -rpcallowip= to accept json-rpc connections from another machine.
* Clean shutdown on SIGTERM on Linux.

Download:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/bitcoin/files/Bitcoin/bitcoin-0.3.13/

(Thanks Laszlo for the Mac OSX build!)

Note:
The SSE2 auto-detect in the Linux 64-bit version doesn't work with AMD in 64-bit mode.  Please try this instead and let me know if it gets it right:
http://www.bitcoin.org/download/bitcoin-0.3.13.1-specialbuild-linux64.tar.gz

You can still control the SSE2 use manually with -4way and -4way=0.

Version 0.3.13.2 (SVN rev 161) has improvements for the case where you already had 0/unconfirmed transactions that you might have already spent.  Here's a Windows build of it:

##0.3.12<ref>[http://forum.bitcoin.org?topic=999.0 0.3.12 release announcement]</ref>=

Version 0.3.12 is now available.

Features:

* json-rpc errors return a more standard error object. (thanks to Gavin Andresen)
* json-rpc command line returns exit codes.
* json-rpc "backupwallet" command.
* Recovers and continues if an exception is caused by a message you received.  Other nodes shouldn't be able to cause an exception, and it hasn't happened before, but if a way is found to cause an exception, this would keep it from being used to stop network nodes.

If you have json-rpc code that checks the contents of the error string, you need to change it to expect error objects of the form {"code":<number>,"message":<string>}, which is the standard.  See this thread:
http://www.bitcoin.org/smf/index.php?topic=969.0
