#Changelogs

##0.3.19



##0.3.18<ref>[http://www.bitcoin.org/smf/index.php?topic=2162.0 0.3.18 release announcement]</ref>=

Changes:

* Fixed a wallet.dat compatibility problem if you downgraded from 0.3.17 and then upgraded again
* IsStandard() check to only include known transaction types in blocks
* Jgarzik's optimisation to speed up the initial block download a little

The main addition in this release is the Accounts-Based JSON-RPC commands that Gavin's been working on (more details at http://www.bitcoin.org/smf/index.php?topic=1886.0).  

* getaccountaddress
* sendfrom
* move
* getbalance
* listtransactions

##0.3.17<ref>[http://www.bitcoin.org/smf/index.php?topic=1946.0 0.3.17 release announcement]</ref>=

Version 0.3.17 is now available.

Changes:

* new getwork, thanks m0mchil
* added transaction fee setting in UI options menu
* free transaction limits
* sendtoaddress returns transaction id instead of "sent"
* getaccountaddress <account>

The UI transaction fee setting was easy since it was still there from 0.1.5 and all I had to do was re-enable it.

The accounts-based commands: move, sendfrom and getbalance <account> will be in the next release.  We still have some more changes to make first.

##0.3.16

Never released.

##0.3.15<ref>[http://www.bitcoin.org/smf/index.php?topic=1780.0 0.3.15 release announcement]</ref>=

* paytxfee switch is now per KB, so it adds the correct fee for large transactions
* sending avoids using coins with less than 6 confirmations if it can
* BitcoinMiner processes transactions in priority order based on age of dependencies
* make sure generation doesn't start before block 74000 downloaded
* bugfixes by Dean Gores
* testnet, keypoololdest and paytxfee added to getinfo

##0.3.13<ref>[http://www.bitcoin.org/smf/index.php?topic=1327.0 0.3.13 release announcement]</ref>=

Version 0.3.13 is now available.  You should upgrade to prevent potential problems with 0/unconfirmed transactions.  Note: 0.3.13 prevents problems if you haven't already spent a 0/unconfirmed transaction, but if that already happened, you need 0.3.13.2.

Changes:

* Don't count or spend payments until they have 1 confirmation.
* Internal version number from 312 to 31300.
* Only accept transactions sent by IP address if -allowreceivebyip is specified.
* Dropped DB_PRIVATE Berkeley DB flag.
* Fix problem sending the last cent with sub-cent fractional change.
* Auto-detect whether to use 128-bit 4-way SSE2 on Linux.
Gavin Andresen:

* Option -rpcallowip= to accept json-rpc connections from another machine.
* Clean shutdown on SIGTERM on Linux.

(Thanks Laszlo for the Mac OSX build!)

Note:
The SSE2 auto-detect in the Linux 64-bit version doesn't work with AMD in 64-bit mode.  Please try this instead and let me know if it gets it right:
http://www.bitcoin.org/download/bitcoin-0.3.13.1-specialbuild-linux64.tar.gz

You can still control the SSE2 use manually with -4way and -4way=0.

Version 0.3.13.2 (SVN rev 161) has improvements for the case where you already had 0/unconfirmed transactions that you might have already spent.  Here's a Windows build of it:

##0.3.12<ref>[http://www.bitcoin.org/smf/index.php?topic=999.0 0.3.12 release announcement]</ref>=

Version 0.3.12 is now available.

Features:

* json-rpc errors return a more standard error object. (thanks to Gavin Andresen)
* json-rpc command line returns exit codes.
* json-rpc "backupwallet" command.
* Recovers and continues if an exception is caused by a message you received.  Other nodes shouldn't be able to cause an exception, and it hasn't happened before, but if a way is found to cause an exception, this would keep it from being used to stop network nodes.

If you have json-rpc code that checks the contents of the error string, you need to change it to expect error objects of the form {"code":<number>,"message":<string>}, which is the standard.  See this thread:
http://www.bitcoin.org/smf/index.php?topic=969.0
