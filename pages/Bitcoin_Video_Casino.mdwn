* Provably Fair - A player’s web browser supplies a random number that BVC must incorporate into the random number generator in a provably consistent way. The BVC server starts by choosing a private server seed for the random number generator that the player’s computer doesn't know. The computer then sends BVC a random number that they must incorporate into the seeding of that random number generator. It is impossible for the server to manipulate the randomization of the game without the user's browser detecting it.
