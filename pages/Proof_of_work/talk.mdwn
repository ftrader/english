##page rename suggestion
I think page should be renamed to "Proof of work". There's no reason this has to be a hyphenated one-word. --[Nanotube](User:Nanotube) 08:02, 26 December 2010 (GMT)

##Outline the reason/concept behind "Mining" (not technical)
Hey guys, love the project, love the idea.  The technical information on this page is fantastic and very interesting, but I think one critical focus that is missing from here and the main website is the *reason* why the "Proof of work" is important.  Why is there mining?  What purpose does it achieve?  How does it help give 'validity' to the currency.  This important area should be explained as a general concept and have a heading of its own i think!  You've covered the technical stuff well, but before that there should be the 'bigger picture' explanation.  And maybe even on the main website?  It's the first question many people will ask.
