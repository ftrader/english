Bitmine AG was a retailer of Bitcoin [[mining]] hardware and [[Bitcoin mining ASICs|ASIC]], both under the name CoinCraft.

## Bankruptcy
On May 20th, 2015, Bitmine AG was declared bankrupt (2.1) (2.2)

## ASIC
The [[Innosilicon A1 Booster / Bitmine Coincraft A1 ASIC|List_of_Bitcoin_mining_ASICs#Innosilicon]] is claimed to have been initially designed by Bitmine and contracted out on a 1-year exclusive availability to Innosilicon, LTD. Co.
In its public declaration regarding its bankruptcy, Bitmine AG singled out Innosilicon as one of the major reasons for its bankruptcy, stating:
[[!template id=quote We engaged this company with a regular contract and entitled them to develop our 28nm ASIC based on our know-how and instructions, along with the full turnkey process of creating the mask, wafers and IC packaging. We had signed a contract that was expecting to guarantee us a one year exclusivity on the chip, however at a later stage we received proof that Innosilicon was plainly violating the contract from day zero and selling our own A1 chips to whoever inquired them directly]]
[[...]]
[[!template id=quote It is also worth mentioning that while we were struggling with thousands of junk chips, the A-grade ones could at all time be purchased in Hong Kong directly from their Chinese resellers, at some point even at lower prices than what we ourselves paid for.]]
