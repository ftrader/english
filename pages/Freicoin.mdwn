[Freicoin](http://freico.in) is "Bitcoin with [demurrage](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demurrage)".

It is an alt chain with the design goal that holders of the coin will have negative interest rates, as a means to increase the [velocity of money](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velocity_of_money) by reducing the incentive to save. Fees are taken for holding coins and distributed to miners.

##FAQ
###Why would someone choose to hold a Freicoin and incur demurrage, where he can just hold Bitcoin instead?
Assuming they already have the Freicoin, exchange fees to Bitcoin may be greater than the loss from demurrage.
