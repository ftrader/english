An escrow-like service that allows safer payment by securely holding a buyer's coins in escrow until the terms of the sale are met. 

<span style="color:red">Warning: Please be careful with your money.  When sending money to an escrow partner you are trusting that the operator will not abscond with your funds and that the operator maintains secure systems that protect against theft -- internal or external.  It is recommended that you obtain the real-world identity of the operator and ensure that sufficient recourse is available.  Exchanging or storing significant amounts of funds others is not recommended.</span>

##Fees

The service charges a 1% escrow fee which includes potential dispute resolution.

##History
