##History

BitcoinZAR started out as a bitcoin fan and  hobby website and followed soon after with the BitcoinZAR Facebook page and twitter pages. When the bitcoin.co.za website was repeatedly hacked and eventually removed, www.bitcoinzar.co.za took over. As the social media pages gained popularity with locals, the website was updated to provide the content the users were looking for.
